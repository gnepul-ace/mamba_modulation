Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any\nof these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\n\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\n\n\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\n\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\n\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\nfrom Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\ndon't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

The Spenser poems will shortly\nbe available as a separate E-text.\n\nSpelling and punctuation: These are the same as in the book as\nfar as possible.  Accents have been removed. Diereses (umlauts)\nhave been removed from English words and replaced by \"e\" in\nGerman ones. The AE and OE digraphs have been transcribed\nas two letters.  The British pound (currency) sign has been\nreplaced by a capital L. Greek words have been transliterated.\n\nFootnotes: The original book has an average of 30 footnotes\nper page.  These were of three types:\n(A) Glosses or explanations of obsolete words and phrases.\nThese have been treated as follows:\n1. In the poems, they have been moved up into the right-hand\nmargin. Some of them have been shortened or paraphrased in\norder to fit.\nExplanations of single words have a single asterisk at the\nend of the word and at the beginning of the explanation*.     *like this\nIf two words in the same line have explanations\nthe first* has one and the second**, two.          *like this **and this\nExplanations of phrases have an asterisk at the\nstart and end *of the phrase* and of the explanation         *like this*\nSometimes these glosses wrap onto the next line, still in the\nright margin. If you read this e-text using a monospaced font\n(like Courier in a word processor such as MS Word, or the\ndefault font in most text editors) then the marginal notes are\nright-justified.\n2. In the prose tales,  they have been imbedded into the text in\nsquare brackets after the word or phrase they refer to [like this].\n(B) Etymological explanations of these words.  These are\nindicted by a number in angle brackets in the marginal\ngloss.* The note will be found at the                     *like this <1>\nend of the poem or section.\n(C) Longer notes commenting on or explaining the text. These\nare indicated in the text by numbers in angle brackets thus: <1>.\nThe note will be found at the end of the poem or section.\n\nLatin: Despite his declared aim of editing the tales \"for popular\nperusal\", Purves has left nearly all Latin quotations\nuntranslated.

Modern scholars believe that Chaucer was not the author of\nthese poems.\n\n\n\n                            PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE object of this volume is to place before the general reader\nour two early poetic masterpieces -- The Canterbury Tales and\nThe Faerie Queen; to do so in a way that will render their\n\"popular perusal\" easy in a time of little leisure and unbounded\ntemptations to intellectual languor; and, on the same conditions,\nto present a liberal and fairly representative selection from the\nless important and familiar poems of Chaucer and Spenser.\nThere is, it may be said at the outset, peculiar advantage and\npropriety in placing the two poets side by side in the manner\nnow attempted for the first time.  Although two centuries divide\nthem, yet Spenser is the direct and really the immediate\nsuccessor to the poetical inheritance of Chaucer.  Those two\nhundred years, eventful as they were, produced no poet at all\nworthy to take up the mantle that fell from Chaucer's shoulders;\nand Spenser does not need his affected archaisms, nor his\nfrequent and reverent appeals to \"Dan Geffrey,\" to vindicate for\nhimself a place very close to his great predecessor in the literary\nhistory of England. If Chaucer is the \"Well of English\nundefiled,\" Spenser is the broad and stately river that yet holds\nthe tenure of its very life from the fountain far away in other\nand ruder scenes.\n\nThe Canterbury Tales, so far as they are in verse, have been\nprinted without any abridgement or designed change in the\nsense.  But the two Tales in prose -- Chaucer's Tale of\nMeliboeus, and the Parson's long Sermon on Penitence -- have\nbeen contracted, so as to exclude thirty pages of unattractive\nprose, and to admit the same amount of interesting and\ncharacteristic poetry.  The gaps thus made in the prose Tales,\nhowever, are supplied by careful outlines of the omitted matter,\nso that the reader need be at no loss to comprehend the whole\nscope and sequence of the original.  With The Faerie Queen a\nbolder course has been pursued. The great obstacle to the\npopularity of Spencer's splendid work has lain less in its\nlanguage than in its length.  If we add together the three great\npoems of antiquity -- the twenty-four books of the Iliad, the\ntwenty-four books of the Odyssey, and the twelve books of the\nAeneid -- we get at the dimensions of only one-half of The\nFaerie Queen.  The six books, and the fragment of a seventh,\nwhich alone exist of the author's contemplated twelve, number\nabout 35,000 verses; the sixty books of Homer and Virgil\nnumber no more than 37,000. The mere bulk of the poem, then,\nhas opposed a formidable barrier to its popularity; to say\nnothing of the distracting effect produced by the numberless\nepisodes, the tedious narrations, and the constant repetitions,\nwhich have largely swelled that bulk.  In this volume the poem\nis compressed into two-thirds of its original space, through the\nexpedient of representing the less interesting and more\nmechanical passages by a condensed prose outline, in which it\nhas been sought as far as possible to preserve the very words of\nthe poet.  While deprecating a too critical judgement on the\nbare and constrained precis standing in such trying\njuxtaposition, it is hoped that the labour bestowed in saving the\nreader the trouble of wading through much that is not essential\nfor the enjoyment of Spencer's marvellous allegory, will not be\nunappreciated.\n\nAs regards the manner in which the text of the two great works,\nespecially of The Canterbury Tales, is presented, the Editor is\naware that some whose judgement is weighty will differ from\nhim.  This volume has been prepared \"for popular perusal;\" and\nits very raison d'etre would have failed, if the ancient\northography had been retained.  It has often been affirmed by\neditors of Chaucer in the old forms of the language, that a little\ntrouble at first would render the antiquated spelling and\nobsolete inflections a continual source, not of difficulty, but of\nactual delight, for the reader coming to the study of Chaucer\nwithout any preliminary acquaintance with the English of his\nday -- or of his copyists' days.  Despite this complacent\nassurance, the obvious fact is, that Chaucer in the old forms has\nnot become popular, in the true sense of the word; he is not\n\"understanded of the vulgar.\"  In this volume, therefore, the text\nof Chaucer has been presented in nineteenth-century garb.  But\nthere has been not the slightest attempt to \"modernise\"\nChaucer, in the wider meaning of the phrase; to replace his\nwords by words which he did not use; or, following the example\nof some operators, to translate him into English of the modern\nspirit as well as the modern forms.  So far from that, in every\ncase where the old spelling or form seemed essential to metre,\nto rhyme, or meaning, no change has been attempted.  But,\nwherever its preservation was not essential, the spelling of the\nmonkish transcribers -- for the most ardent purist must now\ndespair of getting at the spelling of Chaucer himself -- has been\ndiscarded for that of the reader's own day.  It is a poor\ncompliment to the Father of English Poetry, to say that by such\ntreatment the bouquet and individuality of his works must be\nlost.  If his masterpiece is valuable for one thing more than any\nother, it is the vivid distinctness with which English men and\nwomen of the fourteenth century are there painted, for the study\nof all the centuries to follow.  But we wantonly balk the artist's\nown purpose, and discredit his labour, when we keep before his\npicture the screen of dust and cobwebs which, for the English\npeople in these days, the crude forms of the infant language\nhave practically become.  Shakespeare has not suffered by\nsimilar changes; Spencer has not suffered; it would be surprising\nif Chaucer should suffer, when the loss of popular\ncomprehension and favour in his case are necessarily all the\ngreater for his remoteness from our day.  In a much smaller\ndegree -- since previous labours in the same direction had left\nfar less to do -- the same work has been performed for the\nspelling of Spenser; and the whole endeavour in this department\nof the Editor's task has been, to present a text plain and easily\nintelligible to the modern reader, without any injustice to the old\npoet.  It would be presumptuous to believe that in every case\nboth ends have been achieved together; but the laudatores\ntemporis acti - the students who may differ most from the plan\npursued in this volume -- will best appreciate the difficulty of\nthe enterprise, and most leniently regard any failure in the\ndetails of its accomplishment.\n\nWith all the works of Chaucer, outside The Canterbury Tales, it\nwould have been absolutely impossible to deal within the scope\nof this volume.  But nearly one hundred pages, have been\ndevoted to his minor poems; and, by dint of careful selection\nand judicious abridgement -- a connecting outline of the story in\nall such cases being given -- the Editor ventures to hope that he\nhas presented fair and acceptable specimens of Chaucer's\nworkmanship in all styles.  The preparation of this part of the\nvolume has been a laborious task; no similar attempt on the\nsame scale has been made; and, while here also the truth of the\ntext in matters essential has been in nowise sacrificed to mere\nease of perusal, the general reader will find opened up for him a\nnew view of Chaucer and his works.  Before a perusal of these\nhundred pages, will melt away for ever the lingering tradition or\nprejudice that Chaucer was only, or characteristically, a coarse\nbuffoon, who pandered to a base and licentious appetite by\npainting and exaggerating the lowest vices of his time.  In these\nselections -- made without a thought of taking only what is to\nthe poet's credit from a wide range of poems in which hardly a\nword is to his discredit -- we behold Chaucer as he was; a\ncourtier, a gallant, pure-hearted gentleman, a scholar, a\nphilosopher, a poet of gay and vivid fancy, playing around\nthemes of chivalric convention, of deep human interest, or\nbroad-sighted satire.  In The Canterbury Tales, we see, not\nChaucer, but Chaucer's times and neighbours; the artist has lost\nhimself in his work. To show him honestly and without disguise,\nas he lived his own life and sung his own songs at the brilliant\nCourt of Edward III, is to do his memory a moral justice far\nmore material than any wrong that can ever come out of\nspelling.  As to the minor poems of Spenser, which follow The\nFaerie Queen, the choice has been governed by the desire to\ngive at once the most interesting, and the most characteristic of\nthe poet's several styles; and, save in the case of the Sonnets,\nthe poems so selected are given entire. It is manifest that the\nendeavours to adapt this volume for popular use, have been\nalready noticed, would imperfectly succeed without the aid of\nnotes and glossary, to explain allusions that have become\nobsolete, or antiquated words which it was necessary to retain.\nAn endeavour has been made to render each page self-\nexplanatory, by placing on it all the glossarial and illustrative\nnotes required for its elucidation, or -- to avoid repetitions that\nwould have occupied space -- the references to the spot where\ninformation may be found.  The great advantage of such a plan\nto the reader, is the measure of its difficulty for the editor.  It\npermits much more flexibility in the choice of glossarial\nexplanations or equivalents; it saves the distracting and time-\nconsuming reference to the end or the beginning of the book;\nbut, at the same time, it largely enhances the liability to error.\nThe Editor is conscious that in the 12,000 or 13,000 notes, as\nwell as in the innumerable minute points of spelling,\naccentuation, and rhythm, he must now and again be found\ntripping; he can only ask any reader who may detect all that he\ncould himself point out as being amiss, to set off against\ninevitable mistakes and misjudgements, the conscientious labour\nbestowed on the book, and the broad consideration of its fitness\nfor the object contemplated.\n\n From books the Editor has derived valuable help; as from Mr\nCowden Clarke's revised modern text of The Canterbury Tales,\npublished in Mr Nimmo's Library Edition of the English Poets;\nfrom Mr Wright's scholarly edition of the same work; from the\nindispensable Tyrwhitt; from Mr Bell's edition of Chaucer's\nPoem; from Professor Craik's \"Spenser and his Poetry,\"\npublished twenty-five years ago by Charles Knight; and from\nmany others. In the abridgement of the Faerie Queen,  the plan\nmay at first sight seem to be modelled on the lines of Mr Craik's\npainstaking condensation; but the coincidences are either\ninevitable or involuntary.  Many of the notes, especially of those\nexplaining classical references and those attached to the minor\npoems of Chaucer, have been prepared specially for this edition.\nThe Editor leaves his task with the hope that his attempt to\nremove artificial obstacles to the popularity of  England's\nearliest poets, will not altogether miscarry.\n\nD. LAING PURVES.\n\n\n\n                    LIFE OF GEOFFREY CHAUCER.\n\n\nNOT in point of genius only, but even in point of time, Chaucer\nmay claim the proud designation of \"first\" English poet. He\nwrote \"The Court of Love\" in 1345, and \"The Romaunt of the\nRose,\" if not also \"Troilus and Cressida,\" probably within the\nnext decade: the dates usually assigned to the poems of\nLaurence Minot extend from 1335 to 1355, while \"The Vision\nof Piers Plowman\" mentions events that occurred in 1360 and\n1362 -- before which date Chaucer had certainly written \"The\nAssembly of Fowls\" and his \"Dream.\" But, though they were\nhis contemporaries, neither Minot nor Langland (if Langland\nwas the author of the Vision) at all approached Chaucer in the\nfinish, the force, or the universal interest of their works and the\npoems of earlier writer; as Layamon and the author of the\n\"Ormulum,\" are less English than Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-\nNorman. Those poems reflected the perplexed struggle for\nsupremacy between the two grand elements of our language,\nwhich marked the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; a struggle\nintimately associated with the political relations between the\nconquering Normans and the subjugated Anglo-Saxons.\nChaucer found two branches of the language; that spoken by\nthe people, Teutonic in its genius and its forms; that spoken by\nthe learned and the noble, based on the French  Yet each branch\nhad begun to borrow of the other -- just as nobles and people\nhad been taught to recognise that each needed the other in the\nwars and the social tasks of the time; and Chaucer, a scholar, a\ncourtier, a man conversant with all orders of society, but\naccustomed to speak, think, and write in the words of the\nhighest, by his comprehensive genius cast into the simmering\nmould a magical amalgamant which made the two half-hostile\nelements unite and interpenetrate each other. Before Chaucer\nwrote, there were two tongues in England, keeping alive the\nfeuds and resentments of cruel centuries; when he laid down his\npen, there was practically but one speech -- there was, and ever\nsince has been, but one people.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, according to the most trustworthy traditions-\nfor authentic testimonies on the subject are wanting -- was born\nin 1328; and London is generally believed to have been his\nbirth-place. It is true that Leland, the biographer of England's\nfirst great poet who lived nearest to his time, not merely speaks\nof Chaucer as having been  born many years later than the date\nnow assigned, but mentions Berkshire or Oxfordshire as the\nscene of his birth. So great uncertainty have some felt on the\nlatter score, that elaborate parallels have been drawn between\nChaucer, and Homer -- for whose birthplace several cities\ncontended, and whose descent was traced to the demigods.\nLeland may seem to have had fair opportunities of getting at the\ntruth about Chaucer's birth -- for Henry VIII had him, at the\nsuppression of the monasteries throughout England, to search\nfor records of public interest the archives of the religious\nhouses. But it may be questioned whether he was likely to find\nmany authentic particulars regarding the personal history of the\npoet in the quarters which he explored; and Leland's testimony\nseems to be set aside by Chaucer's own evidence as to his\nbirthplace, and by the contemporary references which make him\nout an aged man for years preceding the accepted date of his\ndeath. In one of his prose works, \"The Testament of Love,\" the\npoet speaks of himself in terms that strongly confirm the claim\nof London to the honour of giving him birth; for he there\nmentions \"the city of London, that is to me so dear and sweet,\nin which I was forth growen; and more kindly love,\" says he,\n\"have I to that place than to any other in earth; as every kindly\ncreature hath full appetite to that place of his kindly engendrure,\nand to will rest and peace in that place to abide.\" This tolerably\ndirect evidence is supported -- so far as it can be at such an\ninterval of time -- by the learned Camden; in his Annals of\nQueen Elizabeth, he describes Spencer, who was certainly born\nin London, as being a fellow-citizen of Chaucer's -- \"Edmundus\nSpenserus, patria Londinensis, Musis adeo arridentibus natus, ut\nomnes Anglicos superioris aevi poetas, ne Chaucero quidem\nconcive excepto, superaret.\" <1> The records of the time notice\nmore than one person of the name of Chaucer, who held\nhonourable positions about the Court; and though we cannot\ndistinctly trace the poet's relationship with any of these\nnamesakes or antecessors, we find excellent ground for belief\nthat his family or friends stood well at Court, in the ease with\nwhich Chaucer made his way there, and in his subsequent\ncareer.\n\nLike his great successor, Spencer, it was the fortune of Chaucer\nto live under a splendid, chivalrous, and high-spirited reign.\n1328 was the second year of Edward III; and, what with Scotch\nwars, French expeditions, and the strenuous and costly struggle\nto hold England in a worthy place among the States of Europe,\nthere was sufficient bustle, bold achievement, and high ambition\nin the period to inspire a poet who was prepared to catch the\nspirit of the day. It was an age of elaborate courtesy, of high-\npaced gallantry, of courageous venture, of noble disdain for\nmean tranquillity; and Chaucer, on the whole a man of peaceful\navocations, was penetrated to the depth of his consciousness\nwith the lofty and lovely civil side of that brilliant and restless\nmilitary period. No record of his youthful years, however,\nremains to us; if we believe that at the age of eighteen he was a\nstudent of Cambridge, it is only on the strength of a reference in\nhis \"Court of Love\", where the narrator is made to say that his\nname is Philogenet, \"of Cambridge clerk;\" while he had  already\ntold us that when he was stirred to seek the Court of Cupid he\nwas \"at eighteen year of age.\" According to Leland, however,\nhe was educated at Oxford, proceeding thence to France and\nthe Netherlands, to finish his studies; but there remains no\ncertain evidence of his having belonged to either University. At\nthe same time, it is not doubted that his family was of good\ncondition; and, whether or not we accept the assertion that his\nfather held the rank of knighthood -- rejecting the hypotheses\nthat make him a merchant, or a vintner \"at the corner of Kirton\nLane\" -- it is plain, from Chaucer's whole career, that he had\nintroductions to public life, and recommendations to courtly\nfavour, wholly independent of his genius. We have the clearest\ntestimony that his mental training was of wide range and\nthorough excellence, altogether rare for a mere courtier in those\ndays: his poems attest his intimate acquaintance with the\ndivinity, the philosophy, and the scholarship of his time, and\nshow him to have had the sciences, as then developed and\ntaught, \"at his fingers' ends.\" Another proof of Chaucer's good\nbirth and fortune would he found in the statement that, after his\nUniversity career was completed, he entered the Inner Temple -\n- the expenses of which could be borne only by men of noble\nand opulent families; but although there is a story that he was\nonce fined two shillings for thrashing a Franciscan friar in Fleet\nStreet, we have no direct authority for believing that the poet\ndevoted himself to the uncongenial study of the law. No special\ndisplay of knowledge on that subject appears in his works; yet\nin the sketch of the Manciple, in the Prologue to the Canterbury\nTales, may be found indications of his familiarity with the\ninternal economy of the Inns of Court; while numerous legal\nphrases and references hint that his comprehensive information\nwas not at fault on legal matters. Leland says that he quitted the\nUniversity \"a ready logician, a smooth rhetorician, a pleasant\npoet, a grave philosopher, an ingenious mathematician, and a\nholy divine;\" and by all accounts, when Geoffrey Chaucer\ncomes before us authentically for the first time, at the age of\nthirty-one, he was possessed of knowledge and\naccomplishments far beyond the common standard of his day.\n\nChaucer at this period possessed also other qualities fitted to\nrecommend him to favour in a Court like that of Edward III.\nUrry describes him, on the authority of a portrait, as being then\n\"of a fair beautiful complexion, his lips red and full, his size of a\njust medium, and his port and air graceful and majestic. So,\"\ncontinues the ardent biographer, -- \"so that every ornament that\ncould claim the approbation of the great and fair, his abilities to\nrecord the valour of the one, and celebrate the beauty of the\nother, and his wit and gentle behaviour to converse with both,\nconspired to make him a complete courtier.\"  If we believe that\nhis \"Court of Love\" had received such publicity as the literary\nmedia of the time allowed in the somewhat narrow and select\nliterary world -- not to speak of \"Troilus and Cressida,\" which,\nas Lydgate mentions it first among Chaucer's works, some have\nsupposed to be a youthful production -- we find a third and not\nless powerful recommendation to the favour of the great co-\noperating with his learning and his gallant bearing. Elsewhere\n<2> reasons have been shown for doubt whether \"Troilus and\nCressida\" should not be assigned to a later period of Chaucer's\nlife; but very little is positively known about the dates and\nsequence of his various works. In the year 1386, being called as\nwitness with regard to a contest on a point of heraldry between\nLord Scrope and Sir Robert Grosvenor, Chaucer deposed that\nhe entered on his military career in 1359. In that year Edward\nIII invaded France, for the third time, in pursuit of his claim to\nthe French crown; and we may fancy that, in describing the\nembarkation of the knights in \"Chaucer's Dream\", the poet\ngained some of the vividness and stir of his picture from his\nrecollections of the embarkation of the splendid and well-\nappointed royal host at Sandwich, on board the eleven hundred\ntransports provided for the enterprise. In this expedition the\nlaurels of Poitiers were flung on the ground; after vainly\nattempting Rheims and Paris, Edward was constrained, by cruel\nweather and lack of provisions, to retreat toward his ships; the\nfury of the elements made the retreat more disastrous than an\noverthrow in pitched battle; horses and men perished by\nthousands, or fell into the hands of the pursuing French.\nChaucer, who had been made prisoner at the siege of Retters,\nwas among the captives in the possession of France when the\ntreaty of Bretigny -- the \"great peace\" -- was concluded, in\nMay, 1360. Returning to England, as we may suppose, at the\npeace, the poet, ere long, fell into another and a pleasanter\ncaptivity; for his marriage is generally believed to have taken\nplace shortly after his release from foreign durance.  He had\nalready gained the personal friendship and favour of John of\nGaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the King's son; the Duke, while Earl\nof Richmond, had courted, and won to wife after a certain\ndelay, Blanche, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Duke of\nLancaster; and Chaucer is by some believed to have written\n\"The Assembly of Fowls\" to celebrate the wooing, as he wrote\n\"Chaucer's Dream\" to celebrate the wedding, of his patron. The\nmarriage took place in 1359, the year of Chaucer's expedition to\nFrance; and as, in \"The Assembly of Fowls,\" the formel or\nfemale eagle, who is supposed to represent the Lady Blanche,\nbegs that her choice of a mate may be deferred for a year, 1358\nand 1359 have been assigned as the respective dates of the two\npoems already mentioned.  In the \"Dream,\" Chaucer\nprominently introduces his own lady-love, to whom, after the\nhappy union of his patron with the Lady Blanche, he is wedded\namid great rejoicing; and various expressions in the same poem\nshow that not only was the poet high in favour with the\nillustrious pair, but that his future wife had also peculiar claims\non their regard.  She was the younger daughter of Sir Payne\nRoet, a native of Hainault, who had, like many of his\ncountrymen, been attracted to England by the example and\npatronage of Queen Philippa. The favourite attendant on the\nLady Blanche was her elder sister Katherine: subsequently\nmarried to Sir Hugh Swynford, a gentleman of Lincolnshire;\nand destined, after the death of Blanche, to be in succession\ngoverness of her children, mistress of John of Gaunt, and\nlawfully-wedded Duchess of Lancaster. It is quite sufficient\nproof that Chaucer's position at Court was of no mean\nconsequence, to find that his wife, the sister of the future\nDuchess of Lancaster, was one of the royal maids of honour,\nand even, as Sir Harris Nicolas conjectures, a god-daughter of\nthe Queen -- for her name also was Philippa.\n\nBetween 1359, when the poet himself testifies that he was made\nprisoner while bearing arms in France, and September 1366,\nwhen Queen Philippa granted to her former maid of honour, by\nthe name of Philippa Chaucer, a yearly pension of ten marks, or\nL6, 13s. 4d., we have no authentic mention of Chaucer, express\nor indirect. It is plain from this grant that the poet's marriage\nwith Sir Payne Roet's daughter was not celebrated later than\n1366; the probability is, that it closely followed his return from\nthe wars. In 1367, Edward III. settled upon Chaucer a life-\npension of twenty marks, \"for the good service which our\nbeloved Valet -- 'dilectus Valettus noster' -- Geoffrey Chaucer\nhas rendered, and will render in time to come.\" Camden\nexplains 'Valettus hospitii' to signify a Gentleman of the Privy\nChamber; Selden says that the designation was bestowed \"upon\nyoung heirs designed to he knighted, or young gentlemen of\ngreat descent and quality.\" Whatever the strict meaning of the\nword, it is plain that the poet's position was honourable and\nnear to the King's person, and also that his worldly\ncircumstances were easy, if not affluent -- for it need not be said\nthat twenty marks in those days represented twelve or twenty\ntimes the sum in these.  It is believed that he found powerful\npatronage, not merely from the Duke of Lancaster and his wife,\nbut from Margaret Countess of Pembroke, the King's daughter.\nTo her Chaucer is supposed to have addressed the \"Goodly\nBallad\", in which the lady is celebrated under the image of the\ndaisy; her he is by some understood to have represented under\nthe title of Queen Alcestis, in the \"Court of Love\" and the\nPrologue to \"The Legend of Good Women;\" and in her praise\nwe may read his charming descriptions and eulogies of the daisy\n-- French, \"Marguerite,\" the name of his Royal patroness. To\nthis period of Chaucer's career we may probably attribute the\nelegant and courtly, if somewhat conventional, poems of \"The\nFlower and the Leaf,\" \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale,\" &c.\n\"The Lady Margaret,\" says Urry, \". . . would frequently\ncompliment him upon his poems. But this is not to be meant of\nhis Canterbury Tales, they being written in the latter part of his\nlife, when the courtier and the fine gentleman gave way to solid\nsense and plain descriptions. In his love-pieces he was obliged\nto have the strictest regard to modesty and decency; the ladies\nat that time insisting so much upon the nicest punctilios of\nhonour, that it was highly criminal to depreciate their sex, or do\nanything that might offend virtue.\" Chaucer, in their estimation,\nhad sinned against the dignity and honour of womankind by his\ntranslation of the French \"Roman de la Rose,\" and by his\n\"Troilus and Cressida\" -- assuming it to have been among his\nless mature works; and to atone for those offences the Lady\nMargaret (though other and older accounts say that it was the\nfirst Queen of Richard II., Anne of Bohemia), prescribed to him\nthe task of writing \"The Legend of Good Women\" (see\nintroductory note to that poem). About this period, too, we\nmay place the composition of Chaucer's A. B. C., or The Prayer\nof Our Lady, made at the request of the Duchess Blanche, a\nlady of great devoutness in her private life. She died in 1369;\nand Chaucer, as he had allegorised her wooing, celebrated her\nmarriage, and aided her devotions, now lamented her death, in a\npoem entitled \"The Book of the Duchess; or, the Death of\nBlanche.<3>\n\nIn 1370, Chaucer was employed on the King's service abroad;\nand in November 1372, by the title of \"Scutifer noster\" -- our\nEsquire or Shield-bearer -- he was associated with \"Jacobus\nPronan,\" and \"Johannes de Mari civis Januensis,\" in a royal\ncommission, bestowing full powers to treat with the Duke of\nGenoa, his Council, and State.  The object of the embassy was\nto negotiate upon the choice of an English port at which the\nGenoese might form a commercial establishment; and Chaucer,\nhaving quitted England in December, visited Genoa and\nFlorence, and returned to England before the end of November\n1373 -- for on that day he drew his pension from the Exchequer\nin person. The most interesting point connected with this Italian\nmission is the question, whether Chaucer visited Petrarch at\nPadua. That he did, is unhesitatingly affirmed by the old\nbiographers; but the authentic notices of Chaucer during the\nyears 1372-1373, as shown by the researches of Sir Harris\nNicolas, are confined to the facts already stated; and we are left\nto answer the question by the probabilities of the case, and by\nthe aid of what faint light the poet himself affords. We can\nscarcely fancy that Chaucer, visiting Italy for the first time, in a\ncapacity which opened for him easy access to the great and the\nfamous, did not embrace the chance of meeting a poet whose\nworks he evidently knew in their native tongue, and highly\nesteemed.  With Mr Wright, we are strongly disinclined to\nbelieve \"that Chaucer did not profit by the opportunity . . . of\nimproving his acquaintance with the poetry, if not the poets, of\nthe country he thus visited, whose influence was now being felt\non the literature of most countries of Western Europe.\" That\nChaucer was familiar with the Italian language appears not\nmerely from his repeated selection as Envoy to Italian States,\nbut by many passages in his poetry, from \"The Assembly of\nFowls\" to \"The Canterbury Tales.\" In the opening of the first\npoem  there is a striking parallel to Dante's inscription on the\ngate of Hell.  The first Song of Troilus, in \"Troilus and\nCressida\", is a nearly literal translation of Petrarch's 88th\nSonnet. In the Prologue to \"The Legend of Good Women\",\nthere is a reference to Dante which can hardly have reached the\npoet at second- hand. And in Chaucer's great work -- as in The\nWife of Bath's Tale, and The Monk's Tale  -- direct reference by\nname is made to Dante, \"the wise poet of Florence,\" \"the great\npoet of Italy,\" as the source whence the author has quoted.\nWhen we consider the poet's high place in literature and at\nCourt, which could not fail to make him free of the hospitalities\nof the brilliant little Lombard States; his familiarity with the\ntongue and the works of Italy's greatest bards, dead and living;\nthe reverential regard which he paid to the memory of great\npoets, of which we have examples in \"The House of Fame,\" and\nat the close of \"Troilus and Cressida\" <4>; along with his own\ntestimony in the Prologue to The Clerk's Tale, we cannot fail to\nconstrue that testimony as a declaration that the Tale was\nactually told to Chaucer by the lips of Petrarch, in 1373, the\nvery year in which Petrarch translated it into Latin, from\nBoccaccio's \"Decameron.\"<5>   Mr Bell notes the objection to\nthis interpretation, that the words are put into the mouth, not of\nthe poet, but of the Clerk; and meets it by the counter-\nobjection, that the Clerk, being a purely imaginary personage,\ncould not have learned the story at Padua from Petrarch -- and\ntherefore that Chaucer must have departed from the dramatic\nassumption maintained in the rest of the dialogue. Instances\ncould be adduced from Chaucer's writings to show that such a\nsudden \"departure from the dramatic assumption\" would not be\nunexampled: witness the \"aside\" in The Wife of Bath's\nPrologue, where, after the jolly Dame has asserted that \"half so\nboldly there can no man swear and lie as a woman can\", the\npoet hastens to interpose, in his own person, these two lines:\n\n\"I say not this by wives that be wise,\nBut if it be when they them misadvise.\"\n\nAnd again, in the Prologue to the \"Legend of Good Women,\"\nfrom a description of the daisy --\n\n\"She is the clearness and the very light,\nThat in this darke world me guides and leads,\"\n\nthe poet, in the very next lines, slides into an address to his lady:\n\n\"The heart within my sorrowful heart you dreads\nAnd loves so sore, that ye be, verily,\nThe mistress of my wit, and nothing I,\" &c.\n\nWhen, therefore, the Clerk of Oxford is made to say that he will\ntell a tale --\n\n                          \"The which that I\nLearn'd at Padova of a worthy clerk,\nAs proved by his wordes and his werk.\nHe is now dead, and nailed in his chest,\nI pray to God to give his soul good rest.\nFrancis Petrarc', the laureate poete,\nHighte this clerk, whose rhetoric so sweet\nIllumin'd all Itaile of poetry. . . .\nBut forth to tellen of this worthy man,\nThat taughte me this tale, as I began.\" . . .\n\nwe may without violent effort believe that Chaucer speaks in his\nown person, though dramatically the words are on the Clerk's\nlips.  And the belief is not impaired by the sorrowful way in\nwhich the Clerk lingers on Petrarch's death -- which would be\nless intelligible if the fictitious narrator had only read the story\nin the Latin translation, than if we suppose the news of\nPetrarch's death at Arqua in July 1374 to have closely followed\nChaucer to England, and to have cruelly and irresistibly mingled\nitself with our poet's personal recollections of his great Italian\ncontemporary.  Nor must we regard as without significance the\nmanner in which the Clerk is made to distinguish between the\n\"body\" of Petrarch's tale, and the fashion in which it was set\nforth in writing, with a proem that seemed \"a thing\nimpertinent\", save that the poet had chosen in that way to\n\"convey his matter\" -- told, or \"taught,\" so much more directly\nand simply by word of mouth. It is impossible to pronounce\npositively on the subject; the question whether Chaucer saw\nPetrarch in 1373 must remain a moot-point, so long as we have\nonly our present information; but fancy loves to dwell on the\nthought of the two poets conversing under the vines at Arqua;\nand we find in the history and the writings of Chaucer nothing\nto contradict, a good deal to countenance, the belief that such a\nmeeting occurred.\n\nThough we have no express record, we have indirect testimony,\nthat Chaucer's Genoese mission was discharged satisfactorily;\nfor on the 23d of April 1374, Edward III grants at Windsor to\nthe poet, by the title of \"our beloved squire\" -- dilecto Armigero\nnostro -- unum pycher. vini, \"one pitcher of wine\" daily, to be\n\"perceived\" in the port of London; a grant which, on the\nanalogy of more modern usage, might he held equivalent to\nChaucer's appointment as Poet Laureate. When we find that\nsoon afterwards the grant was commuted for a money payment\nof twenty marks per annum, we need not conclude that\nChaucer's circumstances were poor; for it may be easily\nsupposed that the daily \"perception\" of such an article of\nincome was attended with considerable prosaic inconvenience.\nA permanent provision for Chaucer was made on the 8th of\nJune 1374, when he was appointed Controller of the Customs in\nthe Port of London, for the lucrative imports of wools, skins or\n\"wool-fells,\" and tanned hides -- on condition that he should\nfulfil the duties of that office in person and not by deputy, and\nshould write out the accounts with his own hand.  We have\nwhat seems evidence of Chaucer's compliance with these terms\nin \"The House of Fame\", where, in the mouth of the eagle, the\npoet describes himself, when he has finished his labour and\nmade his reckonings, as not seeking rest and news in social\nintercourse, but going home to his own house, and there, \"all so\ndumb as any stone,\" sitting \"at another book,\" until his look is\ndazed; and again, in the record that in 1376 he received a grant\nof L731, 4s. 6d., the amount of a fine levied on one John Kent,\nwhom Chaucer's vigilance had frustrated in the attempt to ship a\nquantity of wool for Dordrecht without paying the duty. The\nseemingly derogatory condition, that the Controller should\nwrite out the accounts or rolls (\"rotulos\") of his office with his\nown hand, appears to have been designed, or treated, as merely\nformal; no records in Chaucer's handwriting are known to exist\n-- which could hardly be the case if, for the twelve years of his\nControllership (1374-1386), he had duly complied with the\ncondition; and during that period he was more than once\nemployed abroad, so that the condition was evidently regarded\nas a formality even by those who had imposed it.  Also in 1374,\nthe Duke of Lancaster, whose ambitious views may well have\nmade him anxious to retain the adhesion of a man so capable\nand accomplished as Chaucer, changed into a joint life-annuity\nremaining to the survivor, and charged on the revenues of the\nSavoy, a pension of L10 which two years before he settled on\nthe poet's wife -- whose sister was then the governess of the\nDuke's two daughters, Philippa and Elizabeth, and the Duke's\nown mistress.  Another proof of Chaucer's personal reputation\nand high Court favour at this time, is his selection (1375) as\nward to the son of Sir Edmond Staplegate of Bilsynton, in Kent;\na charge on the surrender of which the guardian received no\nless a sum than L104.\n\nWe find Chaucer in 1376 again employed on a foreign mission.\nIn 1377, the last year of Edward III., he was sent to Flanders\nwith Sir Thomas Percy, afterwards Earl of Worcester, for the\npurpose of obtaining a prolongation of the truce; and in January\n13738, he was associated with Sir Guichard d'Angle and other\nCommissioners, to pursue certain negotiations for a marriage\nbetween Princess Mary of France and the young King Richard\nII., which had been set on foot before the death of Edward III.\nThe negotiation, however, proved fruitless; and in May 1378,\nChaucer was selected to accompany Sir John Berkeley on a\nmission to the Court of Bernardo Visconti, Duke of Milan, with\nthe view, it is supposed, of concerting military plans against the\noutbreak of war with France.  The new King, meantime, had\nshown that he was not insensible to Chaucer's merit  -- or to the\ninfluence of his tutor and the poet's patron, the Duke of\nLancaster; for Richard II. confirmed to Chaucer his pension of\ntwenty marks, along with an equal annual sum, for which the\ndaily pitcher of wine granted in 1374 had been commuted.\nBefore his departure for Lombardy, Chaucer -- still holding his\npost in the Customs -- selected two representatives or trustees,\nto protect his estate against legal proceedings in his absence, or\nto sue in his name defaulters and offenders against the imposts\nwhich he was charged to enforce. One of these trustees was\ncalled Richard Forrester; the other was John Gower, the poet,\nthe most famous English contemporary of Chaucer, with whom\nhe had for many years been on terms of admiring friendship --\nalthough, from the strictures passed on certain productions of\nGower's in the Prologue to The Man of Law's Tale,<6> it has\nbeen supposed that in the later years of Chaucer's life the\nfriendship suffered some diminution. To the \"moral Gower\" and\n\"the philosophical Strode,\" Chaucer \"directed\" or dedicated his\n\"Troilus and Cressida;\" <7> while, in the \"Confessio Amantis,\"\nGower introduces a handsome compliment to his greater\ncontemporary, as the \"disciple and the poet\" of Venus, with\nwhose glad songs and ditties, made in her praise during the\nflowers of his youth, the land was filled everywhere.  Gower,\nhowever -- a monk and a Conservative -- held to the party of\nthe Duke of Gloucester, the rival of the Wycliffite and\ninnovating Duke of Lancaster, who was Chaucer's patron, and\nwhose cause was not a little aided by Chaucer's strictures on the\nclergy; and thus it is not impossible that political differences\nmay have weakened the old bonds of personal friendship and\npoetic esteem. Returning from Lombardy early in 1379,\nChaucer seems to have been again sent abroad; for the records\nexhibit no trace of him between May and December of that\nyear. Whether by proxy or in person, however, he received his\npensions regularly until 1382, when his income was increased\nby his appointment to the post of Controller of Petty Customs\nin the port of London.  In November 1384, he obtained a\nmonth's leave of absence on account of his private affairs, and a\ndeputy was appointed to fill his place; and in February of the\nnext year he was permitted to appoint a permanent deputy --\nthus at length gaining relief from that close attention to business\nwhich probably curtailed the poetic fruits of the poet's most\npowerful years. <8>\n\nChaucer is next found occupying a post which has not often\nbeen held by men gifted with his peculiar genius -- that of a\ncounty member. The contest between the Dukes of Gloucester\nand Lancaster, and their adherents, for the control of the\nGovernment, was coming to a crisis; and when the recluse and\nstudious Chaucer was induced to offer himself to the electors of\nKent as one of the knights of their shire -- where presumably he\nheld property -- we may suppose that it was with the view of\nsupporting his patron's cause in the impending conflict. The\nParliament in which the poet sat assembled at Westminster on\nthe 1st of October, and was dissolved on the 1st of November,\n1386. Lancaster was fighting and intriguing abroad, absorbed in\nthe affairs of his Castilian succession; Gloucester and his friends\nat home had everything their own way; the Earl of Suffolk was\ndismissed from the woolsack, and impeached by the Commons;\nand although Richard at first stood out courageously for the\nfriends of his uncle Lancaster, he was constrained, by the refusal\nof supplies, to consent to the proceedings of Gloucester. A\ncommission was wrung from him, under protest, appointing\nGloucester, Arundel, and twelve other Peers and prelates, a\npermanent council to inquire into the condition of all the public\ndepartments, the courts of law, and the royal household, with\nabsolute powers of redress and dismissal. We need not ascribe\nto Chaucer's Parliamentary exertions in his patron's behalf, nor\nto any malpractices in his official conduct, the fact that he was\namong the earliest victims of the commission.<9>  In December\n1386, he was dismissed from both his offices in the port of\nLondon; but he retained his pensions, and drew them regularly\ntwice a year at the Exchequer until 1388. In 1387, Chaucer's\npolitical reverses were aggravated by a severe domestic\ncalamity: his wife died, and with her died the pension which had\nbeen settled on her by Queen Philippa in 1366, and confirmed to\nher at Richard's accession in 1377.  The change made in\nChaucer's pecuniary position, by the loss of his offices and his\nwife's pension, must have been very great. It would appear that\nduring his prosperous times he had lived in a style quite equal to\nhis income, and had no ample resources against a season of\nreverse; for, on the 1st of May 1388, less than a year and a half\nafter being dismissed from the Customs, he was constrained to\nassign his pensions, by surrender in Chancery, to one John\nScalby.  In May 1389, Richard II., now of age, abruptly\nresumed the reins of government, which, for more than two\nyears, had been ably but cruelly managed by Gloucester. The\nfriends of Lancaster were once more supreme in the royal\ncouncils, and Chaucer speedily profited by the change. On the\n12th of July he was appointed Clerk of the King's Works at the\nPalace of Westminster, the Tower, the royal manors of\nKennington, Eltham, Clarendon, Sheen, Byfleet, Childern\nLangley, and Feckenham, the castle of Berkhamstead, the royal\nlodge of Hathenburgh in the New Forest, the lodges in the\nparks of Clarendon, Childern Langley, and Feckenham, and the\nmews for the King's falcons at Charing Cross; he received a\nsalary of two shillings per day, and was allowed to perform the\nduties by deputy. For some reason unknown, Chaucer held this\nlucrative office <10> little more than two years, quitting it\nbefore the 16th of September 1391, at which date it had passed\ninto the hands of one John Gedney. The next two years and a\nhalf are a blank, so far as authentic records are concerned;\nChaucer is supposed to have passed them in retirement,\nprobably devoting them principally to the composition of The\nCanterbury Tales. In February 1394, the King conferred upon\nhim a grant of L20 a year for life; but he seems to have had no\nother source of income, and to have become embarrassed by\ndebt, for frequent memoranda of small advances on his pension\nshow that his circumstances were, in comparison, greatly\nreduced.  Things appear to have grown worse and worse with\nthe poet; for in May 1398 he was compelled to obtain from the\nKing letters of protection against arrest, extending over a term\nof two years. Not for the first time, it is true -- for similar\ndocuments had been issued at the beginning of Richard's reign;\nbut at that time Chaucer's missions abroad, and his responsible\nduties in the port of London, may have furnished reasons for\nsecuring him against annoyance or frivolous prosecution, which\nwere wholly wanting at the later date.  In 1398, fortune began\nagain to smile upon him; he received a royal grant of a tun of\nwine annually, the value being about L4. Next year, Richard II\nhaving been deposed by the son of John of Gaunt <11>  --\nHenry of Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster -- the new King, four\ndays after hits accession, bestowed on Chaucer a grant of forty\nmarks (L26, 13s. 4d.) per annum, in addition to the pension of\nL20 conferred by Richard II. in 1394.  But the poet, now\nseventy-one years of age, and probably broken down by the\nreverses of the past few years, was not destined long to enjoy\nhis renewed prosperity.  On Christmas Eve of 1399, he entered\non the possession of a house in the garden of the Chapel of the\nBlessed Mary of Westminster -- near to the present site of\nHenry VII.'s Chapel -- having obtained a lease from Robert\nHermodesworth, a monk of the adjacent convent, for fifty-three\nyears, at the annual rent of four marks (L2, 13s. 4d.) Until the\n1st of March 1400, Chaucer drew his pensions in person; then\nthey were received for him by another hand; and on the 25th of\nOctober, in the same year, he died, at the age of seventy-two.\nThe only lights thrown by his poems on his closing days are\nfurnished in the little ballad called \"Good Counsel of Chaucer,\"\n-- which, though said to have been written when \"upon his\ndeath-bed lying in his great anguish, \"breathes the very spirit of\ncourage, resignation, and philosophic calm; and by the\n\"Retractation\" at the end of The Canterbury Tales, which, if it\nwas not foisted in by monkish transcribers, may be supposed the\neffect of Chaucer's regrets and self-reproaches on that solemn\nreview of his life-work which the close approach of death\ncompelled. The poet was buried in Westminster Abbey; <12>\nand not many years after his death a slab was  placed on a pillar\nnear his grave, bearing the lines, taken from an epitaph or\neulogy made by Stephanus Surigonus of Milan, at the request of\nCaxton:\n\n\"Galfridus Chaucer, vates, et fama poesis\nMaternae, hoc sacra sum tumulatus humo.\" <13>\n\nAbout 1555, Mr Nicholas Brigham, a gentleman of Oxford who\ngreatly admired the genius of Chaucer, erected the present\ntomb, as near to the spot where the poet lay, \"before the chapel\nof St Benet,\" as was then possible by reason of the \"cancelli,\"\n<14> which the Duke of Buckingham subsequently obtained\nleave to remove, that room might be made for the tomb of\nDryden.  On the structure of Mr Brigham, besides a full-length\nrepresentation of Chaucer, taken from a portrait drawn by his\n\"scholar\" Thomas Occleve, was -- or is, though now almost\nillegible -- the following inscription:--\n\n                              M. S.\n            QUI FUIT ANGLORUM VATES TER MAXIMUS OLIM,\n             GALFRIDUS CHAUCER CONDITUR HOC TUMULO;\n            ANNUM SI QUAERAS DOMINI, SI TEMPORA VITAE,\n           ECCE NOTAE SUBSUNT, QUE TIBI CUNCTA NOTANT.\n                        25 OCTOBRIS 1400.\n                    AERUMNARUM REQUIES MORS.\n           N. BRIGHAM HOS FECIT MUSARUM NOMINE SUMPTUS\n                              1556. <15>\n\nConcerning his personal appearance and habits, Chaucer has not\nbeen reticent in his poetry. Urry sums up the traits of his aspect\nand character fairly thus: \"He was of a middle stature, the latter\npart of his life inclinable to be fat and corpulent, as appears by\nthe Host's bantering him in the journey to Canterbury, and\ncomparing shapes with him.<16>  His face was fleshy, his\nfeatures just and regular, his complexion fair, and somewhat\npale, his hair of a dusky yellow, short and thin; the hair of his\nbeard in two forked tufts, of a wheat colour; his forehead broad\nand smooth; his eyes inclining usually to the ground, which is\nintimated by the Host's words; his whole face full of liveliness, a\ncalm, easy sweetness, and a studious Venerable aspect. . . . As\nto his temper, he had a mixture of the gay, the modest, and the\ngrave. The sprightliness of his humour was more distinguished\nby his writings than by his appearance; which gave occasion to\nMargaret Countess of Pembroke often to rally him upon his\nsilent modesty in company, telling him, that his absence was\nmore agreeable to her than his conversation, since the first was\nproductive of agreeable pieces of wit in his writings, <17> but\nthe latter was filled with a modest deference, and a too distant\nrespect.  We see nothing merry or jocose in his behaviour with\nhis pilgrims, but a silent attention to their mirth, rather than any\nmixture of his own. . .  When disengaged from public affairs, his\ntime was entirely spent in study and reading; so agreeable to\nhim was this exercise, that he says he preferred it to all other\nsports and diversions.<18>  He lived within himself, neither\ndesirous to hear nor busy to concern himself with the affairs of\nhis neighbours. His course of living was temperate and regular;\nhe went to rest with the sun, and rose before it; and by that\nmeans enjoyed the pleasures of the better part of the day, his\nmorning walk and fresh contemplations.  This gave him the\nadvantage of describing the morning in so lively a manner as he\ndoes everywhere in his works. The springing sun glows warm in\nhis lines, and the fragrant air blows cool in his descriptions; we\nsmell the sweets of the bloomy haws, and hear the music of the\nfeathered choir, whenever we take a forest walk with him. The\nhour of the day is not easier to be discovered from the reflection\nof the sun in Titian's paintings, than in Chaucer's morning\nlandscapes. . . . His reading was deep and extensive, his\njudgement sound and discerning. . . In one word, he was a great\nscholar, a pleasant wit, a candid critic, a sociable companion, a\nsteadfast friend, a grave philosopher, a temperate economist,\nand a pious Christian.\"\n\nChaucer's most important poems are \"Troilus and Cressida,\"\n\"The Romaunt of the Rose,\" and \"The Canterbury Tales.\"  Of\nthe first, containing 8246 lines, an abridgement, with a prose\nconnecting outline of the story, is given in this volume. With the\nsecond, consisting of 7699 octosyllabic verses, like those in\nwhich \"The House of Fame\" is written, it was found impossible\nto deal in the present edition. The poem is a curtailed translation\nfrom the French \"Roman de la Rose\" -- commenced by\nGuillaume de Lorris, who died in 1260, after contributing 4070\nverses, and completed, in the last quarter of the thirteenth\ncentury, by Jean de Meun, who added some 18,000 verses. It is\na satirical allegory, in which the vices of courts, the corruptions\nof the clergy, the disorders and inequalities of society in general,\nare unsparingly attacked, and the most revolutionary doctrines\nare advanced; and though, in making his translation, Chaucer\nsoftened or eliminated much of the satire of the poem, still it\nremained, in his verse, a caustic exposure of the abuses of the\ntime, especially those which discredited the Church.\n\nThe Canterbury Tales are presented in this edition with as near\nan approach to completeness as regard for the popular character\nof the volume permitted. The 17,385 verses, of which the\npoetical Tales consist, have been given without abridgement or\npurgation -- save in a single couplet; but, the main purpose of\nthe volume being to make the general reader acquainted with\nthe \"poems\" of Chaucer and Spenser, the Editor has ventured to\ncontract the two prose Tales -- Chaucer's Tale of Meliboeus,\nand the Parson's Sermon or Treatise on Penitence -- so as to\nsave about thirty pages for the introduction of Chaucer's minor\npieces. At the same time, by giving prose outlines of the omitted\nparts, it has been sought to guard the reader against the fear\nthat he was losing anything essential, or even valuable. It is\nalmost needless to describe the plot, or point out the literary\nplace, of the Canterbury Tales. Perhaps in the entire range of\nancient and modern literature there is no work that so clearly\nand freshly paints for future times the picture of the past;\ncertainly no Englishman has ever approached Chaucer in the\npower of fixing for ever the fleeting traits of his own time.  The\nplan of the poem had been adopted before Chaucer chose it;\nnotably in the \"Decameron\" of Boccaccio -- although, there, the\ncircumstances under which the tales were told, with the terror\nof the plague hanging over the merry company, lend a grim\ngrotesqueness to the narrative, unless we can look at it\nabstracted from its setting.  Chaucer, on the other hand, strikes\na perpetual key-note of gaiety whenever he mentions the word\n\"pilgrimage;\" and at every stage of the connecting story we\nbless the happy thought which gives us incessant incident,\nmovement, variety, and unclouded but never monotonous\njoyousness.\n\nThe poet, the evening before he starts on a pilgrimage to the\nshrine of St Thomas at Canterbury, lies at the Tabard Inn, in\nSouthwark, curious to know in what companionship he is\ndestined to fare forward on the morrow. Chance sends him\n\"nine and twenty in a company,\" representing all orders of\nEnglish society, lay and clerical, from the Knight and the Abbot\ndown to the Ploughman and the Sompnour. The jolly Host of\nthe Tabard, after supper, when tongues are loosened and hearts\nare opened, declares that \"not this year\" has he seen such a\ncompany at once under his roof-tree, and proposes that, when\nthey set out next morning, he should ride with them and make\nthem sport. All agree, and Harry Bailly unfolds his scheme: each\npilgrim, including the poet, shall tell two tales on the road to\nCanterbury, and two on the way back to London; and he whom\nthe general voice pronounces to have told the best tale, shall be\ntreated to a supper at the common cost -- and, of course, to\nmine Host's profit -- when the cavalcade returns from the saint's\nshrine to the Southwark hostelry. All joyously assent; and early\non the morrow, in the gay spring sunshine, they ride forth,\nlistening to the heroic tale of the brave and gentle Knight, who\nhas been gracefully chosen by the Host to lead the spirited\ncompetition of story-telling.\n\nTo describe thus the nature of the plan, and to say that when\nChaucer conceived, or at least began to execute it, he was\nbetween sixty and seventy years of age, is to proclaim that The\nCanterbury Tales could never be more than a fragment. Thirty\npilgrims, each telling two tales on the way out, and two more\non the way back -- that makes 120 tales; to say nothing of the\nprologue, the description of the journey, the occurrences at\nCanterbury, \"and all the remnant of their pilgrimage,\" which\nChaucer also undertook. No more than twenty-three of the 120\nstories are told in the work as it comes down to us; that is, only\ntwenty-three of the thirty pilgrims tell the first of the two stories\non the road to Canterbury; while of the stories on the return\njourney we have not one, and nothing is said about the doings\nof the pilgrims at Canterbury -- which would, if treated like the\nscene at the Tabard, have given us a still livelier \"picture of the\nperiod.\" But the plan was too large; and although the poet had\nsome reserves, in stories which he had already composed in an\nindependent form, death cut short his labour ere he could even\ncomplete the arrangement and connection of more than a very\nfew of the Tales. Incomplete as it is, however, the magnum\nopus of Chaucer was in his own time received with immense\nfavour; manuscript copies are numerous even now -- no slight\nproof of its popularity; and when the invention of printing was\nintroduced into England by William Caxton, The Canterbury\nTales issued from his press in the year after the first English-\nprinted book, \"The Game of the Chesse,\" had been struck off.\nInnumerable editions have since been published; and it may\nfairly be affirmed, that few books have been so much in favour\nwith the reading public of every generation as this book, which\nthe lapse of every generation has been rendering more\nunreadable.\n\nApart from \"The Romaunt of the Rose,\" no really important\npoetical work of Chaucer's is omitted from or unrepresented in\nthe present edition. Of \"The Legend of Good Women,\" the\nPrologue only is given -- but it is the most genuinely Chaucerian\npart of the poem.  Of \"The Court of Love,\" three-fourths are\nhere presented; of \"The Assembly of Fowls,\" \"The Cuckoo and\nthe Nightingale,\" \"The Flower and the Leaf,\" all; of \"Chaucer's\nDream,\" one-fourth; of \"The House of Fame,\" two-thirds; and\nof the minor poems such a selection as may give an idea of\nChaucer's power in the \"occasional\" department of verse.\nNecessarily, no space whatever could be given to Chaucer's\nprose works -- his translation of Boethius' Treatise on the\nConsolation of Philosophy; his Treatise on the Astrolabe,\nwritten for the use of his son Lewis; and his \"Testament of\nLove,\" composed in his later years, and reflecting the troubles\nthat then beset the poet. If, after studying in a simplified form\nthe salient works of England's first great bard, the reader is\ntempted to regret that he was not introduced to a wider\nacquaintance with the author, the purpose of the Editor will\nhave been more than attained.\n\nThe plan of the volume does not demand an elaborate\nexamination into the state of our language when Chaucer wrote,\nor the nice questions of grammatical and metrical structure\nwhich conspire with the obsolete orthography to make his\npoems a sealed book for the masses. The most important\nelement in the proper reading of Chaucer's verses -- whether\nwritten in the decasyllabic or heroic metre, which he introduced\ninto our literature, or in the octosyllabic measure used with such\nanimated effect in \"The House of Fame,\" \"Chaucer's Dream,\"\n&c. -- is the sounding of the terminal \"e\" where it is now silent.\nThat letter is still valid in French poetry; and Chaucer's lines can\nbe scanned only by reading them as we would read Racine's or\nMoliere's. The terminal \"e\" played an important part in\ngrammar; in many cases it was the sign of the infinitive -- the\n\"n\" being dropped from the end; at other times it pointed the\ndistinction between singular and plural, between adjective and\nadverb. The pages that follow, however, being prepared from\nthe modern English point of view, necessarily no account is\ntaken of those distinctions; and the now silent \"e\" has been\nretained in the text of Chaucer only when required by the\nmodern spelling, or by the exigencies of metre.\n\nBefore a word beginning with a vowel, or with the letter \"h,\"\nthe final \"e\" was almost without exception mute; and in such\ncases, in the plural forms and infinitives of verbs, the terminal\n\"n\" is generally retained for the sake of euphony. No reader\nwho is acquainted with the French language will find it hard to\nfall into Chaucer's accentuation; while, for such as are not, a\nsimple perusal of the text according to the rules of modern\nverse, should remove every difficulty.\n\n\nNotes to Life of Geoffrey Chaucer\n\n\n1. \"Edmund Spenser, a native of London, was born with a Muse\nof such power, that he was superior to all English poets of\npreceding ages, not excepting his fellow-citizen Chaucer.\"\n\n2.

Called in the editions before 1597 \"The Dream of Chaucer\".\nThe poem, which is not included in the present edition, does\nindeed, like many of Chaucer's smaller works, tell the story of a\ndream, in which a knight, representing John of Gaunt, is found\nby the poet mourning the loss of his lady; but the true \"Dream\nof Chaucer,\" in which he celebrates the marriage of his patron,\nwas published for the first time by Speght in 1597. John of\nGaunt, in the end of 1371, married his second wife, Constance,\ndaughter to Pedro the Cruel of Spain; so that \"The Book of the\nDuchess\" must have been written between 1369 and 1371.\n\n4.

(1392-1393);\" a powerful confirmation of the\nopinion that this poem was really produced in Chaucer's mature\nage. See the introductory notes to it and to the Legend of Good\nWomen.\n\n8. The old biographers of Chaucer, founding on what they took\nto be autobiographic allusions in \"The Testament of Love,\"\nassign to him between 1354 and 1389 a very different history\nfrom that here given on the strength of authentic records\nexplored and quoted by Sir H. Nicolas. Chaucer is made to\nespouse the cause of John of Northampton, the Wycliffite Lord\nMayor of London, whose re-election in 1384 was so\nvehemently opposed by the clergy, and who was imprisoned in\nthe sequel of the grave disorders that arose. The poet, it is said,\nfled to the Continent, taking with him a large sum of money,\nwhich he spent in supporting companions in exile; then,\nreturning by stealth to England in quest of funds, he was\ndetected and sent to the Tower, where he languished for three\nyears, being released only on the humiliating condition of\ninforming against his associates in the plot. The public records\nshow, however, that, all the time of his alleged exile and\ncaptivity, he was quietly living in London, regularly drawing his\npensions in person, sitting in Parliament, and discharging his\nduties in the Customs until his dismissal in 1386. It need not be\nsaid, further, that although Chaucer freely handled the errors,\nthe ignorance, and vices of the clergy, he did so rather as a man\nof sense and of conscience, than as a Wycliffite -- and there is\nno evidence that he espoused the opinions of the zealous\nReformer, far less played the part of an extreme and self-\nregardless partisan of his old friend and college-companion.\n\n9. \"The Commissioners appear to have commenced their\nlabours with examining the accounts of the officers employed in\nthe collection of the revenue; and the sequel affords a strong\npresumption that the royal administration [under Lancaster and\nhis friends] had been foully calumniated. We hear not of any\nfrauds discovered, or of defaulters punished, or of grievances\nredressed.\" Such is the testimony of Lingard (chap. iv., 1386),\nall the more valuable for his aversion from the Wycliffite\nleanings of John of Gaunt. Chaucer's department in the London\nCustoms was in those days one of the most important and\nlucrative in the kingdom; and if mercenary abuse of his post\ncould have been proved, we may be sure that his and his\npatron's enemies would not have been content with simple\ndismissal, but would have heavily amerced or imprisoned him.\n\n10. The salary was L36, 10s. per annum; the salary of the Chief\nJudges was L40, of the Puisne Judges about L27. Probably the\nJudges -- certainly the Clerk of the Works -- had fees or\nperquisites besides the stated payment.\n\n11. Chaucer's patron had died earlier in 1399, during the exile\nof his son (then Duke of Hereford) in France. The Duchess\nConstance had died in 1394; and the Duke had made reparation\nto Katherine Swynford -- who had already borne him four\nchildren -- by marrying her in 1396, with the approval of\nRichard II., who legitimated the children, and made the eldest\nson of the poet's sister-in-law Earl of Somerset. From this long-\nillicit union sprang the house of Beaufort -- that being the\nsurname of the Duke's children by Katherine, after the name of\nthe castle in Anjou (Belfort, or Beaufort) where they were born.\n\n12. Of Chaucer's two sons by Philippa Roet, his only wife, the\nyounger, Lewis, for whom he wrote the Treatise on the\nAstrolabe, died young.  The elder, Thomas, married Maud, the\nsecond daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Burghersh, brother\nof the Bishop of Lincoln, the Chancellor and Treasurer of\nEngland. By this marriage Thomas Chaucer acquired great\nestates in Oxfordshire and elsewhere; and he figured\nprominently in the second rank of courtiers for many years. He\nwas Chief Butler to Richard II.; under Henry IV. he was\nConstable of Wallingford Castle, Steward of the Honours of\nWallingford and St Valery, and of the Chiltern Hundreds; and\nthe queen of Henry IV. granted him the farm of several of her\nmanors, a grant subsequently confirmed to him for life by the\nKing, after the Queen's death. He sat in Parliament repeatedly\nfor Oxfordshire, was Speaker in 1414, and in the same year\nwent to France as commissioner to negotiate the marriage of\nHenry V. with the Princess Katherine. He held, before he died\nin 1434, various other posts of trust and distinction; but he left\nno heirs-male.  His only child, Alice Chaucer, married twice;\nfirst Sir John Philip; and afterwards the Duke of Suffolk --\nattainted and beheaded in 1450.  She had three children by the\nDuke; and her eldest son married the Princess Elizabeth, sister\nof Edward IV. The eldest son of this marriage, created Earl of\nLincoln, was declared by Richard III heir-apparent to the\nthrone, in case the Prince of Wales should die without issue; but\nthe death of Lincoln himself, at the battle of Stoke in 1487,\ndestroyed all prospect that the poet's descendants might\nsucceed to the crown of England; and his family is now believed\nto be extinct.\n\n13. \"Geoffrey Chaucer, bard, and famous mother of poetry, is\nburied in this sacred ground.\"\n\n14.

                    *detained\nBut dwelt at home, and kepte well his fold,\nSo that the wolf ne made it not miscarry.\nHe was a shepherd, and no mercenary.\nAnd though he holy were, and virtuous,\nHe was to sinful men not dispitous*                              *severe\nNor of his speeche dangerous nor dign*                       *disdainful\nBut in his teaching discreet and benign.\nTo drawen

snibbe* sharply for the nones**.  *reprove **nonce,occasion\nA better priest I trow that nowhere none is.\nHe waited after no pomp nor reverence,\nNor maked him a *spiced conscience*,             *artificial conscience*\nBut Christe's lore, and his apostles' twelve,\nHe taught, and first he follow'd it himselve.\n\nWith him there was a PLOUGHMAN, was his brother,\nThat had y-laid of dung full many a fother*.                        *ton\nA true swinker* and a good was he,                          *hard worker\nLiving in peace and perfect charity.\nGod loved he beste with all his heart\nAt alle times, were it gain or smart*,                       *pain, loss\nAnd then his neighebour right as himselve.\nHe woulde thresh, and thereto dike*, and delve,             *dig ditches\nFor Christe's sake, for every poore wight,\nWithouten hire, if it lay in his might.\nHis tithes payed he full fair and well,\nBoth of his *proper swink*, and his chattel**   *his own labour* **goods\nIn a

MILLER was a stout carle for the nones,\nFull big he was of brawn, and eke of bones;\nThat proved well, for *ov'r all where* he came,            *wheresoever*\nAt wrestling he would bear away the ram.<43>\nHe was short-shouldered, broad, a thicke gnarr*,          *stump of wood\nThere was no door, that he n'old* heave off bar,              *could not\nOr break it at a running with his

of hairs\nRed as the bristles of a sowe's ears.\nHis nose-thirles* blacke were and wide.                   *nostrils <45>\nA sword and buckler bare he by his side.\nHis mouth as wide was as a

 *summoner <50>\nThat had a fire-red cherubinnes face,\nFor sausefleme* he was, with eyen narrow.                 *red or pimply\nAs hot he was and lecherous as a sparrow,\nWith scalled browes black,

onions, and leeks,\nAnd for to drink strong wine as red as blood.\nThen would he speak, and cry as he were wood;\nAnd when that he well drunken had the wine,\nThen would he speake no word but Latin.\nA fewe termes knew he, two or three,\nThat he had learned out of some decree;\nNo wonder is, he heard it all the day.\nAnd eke ye knowen well, how that a jay\nCan clepen* \"Wat,\" as well as

goat.\nNo beard had he, nor ever one should have.\nAs smooth it was as it were new y-shave;\nI trow he were a gelding or a mare.\nBut of his craft, from Berwick unto Ware,\nNe was there such another pardonere.\nFor in his mail* he had a pillowbere**,           *bag <58> **pillowcase\nWhich, as he saide, was our Lady's veil:\nHe said, he had a gobbet* of the sail

tway;\nAnd thus with feigned flattering and japes*,                      *jests\nHe made the parson and the people his apes.\nBut truely to tellen at the last,\nHe was in church a noble ecclesiast.\nWell could he read a lesson or a story,\nBut alderbest* he sang an offertory:                        *best of all\nFor well he wiste, when that song was sung,\nHe muste preach, and well afile* his tongue,                     *polish\nTo winne silver, as he right well could:\nTherefore he sang full merrily and loud.\n\nNow have I told you shortly in a clause\nTh' estate, th' array, the number, and eke the cause\nWhy that assembled was this company\nIn Southwark at this gentle hostelry,\nThat highte the Tabard, fast by the Bell.<59>\nBut now is time to you for to tell\n*How that

ne'er so rudely and so large;             *let him speak*\nOr elles he must tell his tale untrue,\nOr feigne things, or finde wordes new.\nHe may not spare, although he were his brother;\nHe must as well say one word as another.\nChrist spake Himself full broad in Holy Writ,\nAnd well ye wot no villainy is it.\nEke Plato saith, whoso that can him read,\nThe wordes must be cousin to the deed.\nAlso I pray you to forgive it me,\n*All have I* not set folk in their degree,             *although I have*\nHere in this tale, as that they shoulden stand:\nMy wit is short, ye may well understand.\n\nGreat cheere made our Host us every one,\nAnd to the supper set he us anon:\nAnd served us with victual of the best.\nStrong was the wine, and well to drink us lest*.                *pleased\nA seemly man Our Hoste was withal\nFor to have been a marshal in an hall.\nA large man he was with eyen steep*,                          *deep-set.\nA fairer burgess is there none in

Tyrwhitt points out that \"the Bull\" should be read  here, not\n\"the Ram,\" which would place the time of  the pilgrimage in the\nend of March; whereas, in the Prologue to the Man of Law's\nTale, the date is given as the \"eight and  twenty day of April,\nthat is messenger to May.\"\n\n2. Dante, in the \"Vita Nuova,\" distinguishes three classes of\npilgrims: palmieri - palmers who go beyond  sea to the East,\nand often bring back staves of palm-wood; peregrini, who go\nthe shrine of St Jago in Galicia; Romei, who go to Rome.   Sir\nWalter Scott, however, says that palmers were in the habit of\npassing from shrine to shrine, living on charity -- pilgrims on the\nother hand, made the journey to any shrine only once,\nimmediately returning to their ordinary avocations. Chaucer\nuses \"palmer\" of all pilgrims.\n\n3. \"Hallows\" survives, in the meaning here given, in All Hallows\n-- All-Saints -- day.  \"Couth,\" past participle of \"conne\" to\nknow, exists in \"uncouth.\"\n\n4. The Tabard -- the sign of the inn -- was a sleeveless coat,\nworn by heralds.  The name of the inn was, some three\ncenturies after Chaucer, changed to the Talbot.\n\n5. In y-fall,\" \"y\" is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon \"ge\"\nprefixed to participles of verbs.  It is used by Chaucer merely to\nhelp the metre  In German,  \"y-fall,\" or  y-falle,\" would be\n\"gefallen\",  \"y-run,\" or \"y-ronne\", would be \"geronnen.\"\n\n6.

The knight had been placed at the head of the table, above\nknights of all nations, in Prussia, whither warriors from all\ncountries were wont to repair, to aid the Teutonic Order in their\ncontinual conflicts with their heathen neighbours in  \"Lettowe\"\nor Lithuania (German. \"Litthauen\"), Russia, &c.\n\n8. Algesiras was taken from the Moorish king of Grenada, in\n1344: the Earls of Derby and Salisbury took part in the siege.\nBelmarie is supposed to have been a Moorish state in Africa;\nbut \"Palmyrie\" has been suggested as the correct reading. The\nGreat Sea, or  the Greek sea, is the Eastern Mediterranean.\nTramissene, or Tremessen, is enumerated by Froissart among\nthe Moorish kingdoms in Africa. Palatie, or  Palathia, in\nAnatolia, was a fief held by the Christian  knights after the\nTurkish conquests -- the holders paying tribute to the infidel.\nOur knight had fought with one of those lords against a heathen\nneighbour.\n\n9.

Maurus, abbot of Fulda from 822 to 842, did\nmuch to re-establish the discipline of the Benedictines on a true\nChristian basis.\n\n17. Wood: Mad, Scottish \"wud\".  Felix says to Paul, \"Too\nmuch learning hath made thee mad\".\n\n18.

departed till the morrow,\nWhen each of them hath *laid his faith to borrow*.   *pledged his faith*\n\nO Cupid, out of alle charity!\nO Regne* that wilt no fellow have with thee!                 *queen <32>\nFull sooth is said, that love nor lordeship\nWill not, *his thanks*, have any fellowship.             *thanks to him*\nWell finden that Arcite and Palamon.\nArcite is ridd anon unto the town,\nAnd on the morrow, ere it were daylight,\nFull privily two harness hath he dight*,                       *prepared\nBoth suffisant and meete to darraine*                           *contest\nThe battle in the field betwixt them twain.\nAnd on his horse, alone as he was born,\nHe carrieth all this harness him beforn;\nAnd in the grove, at time and place y-set,\nThis Arcite and this Palamon be met.\nThen change gan the colour of their face;\nRight as the hunter in the regne* of Thrace                     *kingdom\nThat standeth at a gappe with a spear\nWhen hunted is the lion or the bear,\nAnd heareth him come rushing in the greves*,                     *groves\nAnd breaking both the boughes and the leaves,\nThinketh, \"Here comes my mortal enemy,\nWithoute fail, he must be dead or I;\nFor either I must slay him at the gap;\nOr he must slay me, if that me mishap:\"\nSo fared they, in changing of their hue\n*As far as either of them other knew*.        *When they recognised each\nThere was no good day, and no saluting,                  other afar off*\nBut straight, withoute wordes rehearsing,\nEvereach of them holp to arm the other,\nAs friendly, as he were his owen brother.\nAnd after that, with sharpe speares strong\nThey foined* each at other wonder long.                          *thrust\nThou mightest weene*, that this Palamon                           *think\nIn fighting were as a wood* lion,                                   *mad\nAnd as a cruel tiger was Arcite:\nAs wilde boars gan they together smite,\nThat froth as white as foam, *for ire wood*.            *mad with anger*\nUp to the ancle fought they in their blood.\nAnd in this wise I let them fighting dwell,\nAnd forth I will of Theseus you tell.\n\nThe Destiny, minister general,\nThat executeth in the world o'er all\nThe purveyance*, that God hath seen beforn;              *foreordination\nSo strong it is, that though the world had sworn\nThe contrary of a thing by yea or nay,\nYet some time it shall fallen on a day\nThat falleth not eft* in a thousand year.                         *again\nFor certainly our appetites here,\nBe it of war, or peace, or hate, or love,\nAll is this ruled by the sight* above.         *eye, intelligence, power\nThis mean I now by mighty Theseus,\nThat for to hunten is so desirous --\nAnd namely* the greate hart in May --                        *especially\nThat in his bed there dawneth him no day\nThat he n'is clad, and ready for to ride\nWith hunt and horn, and houndes him beside.\nFor in his hunting hath he such delight,\nThat it is all his joy and appetite\nTo be himself the greate harte's bane*                      *destruction\nFor after Mars he serveth now Diane.\nClear was the day, as I have told ere this,\nAnd Theseus, with alle joy and bliss,\nWith his Hippolyta, the faire queen,\nAnd Emily, y-clothed all in green,\nOn hunting be they ridden royally.\nAnd to the grove, that stood there faste by,\nIn which there was an hart, as men him told,\nDuke Theseus the straighte way doth hold,\nAnd to the laund* he rideth him full right,                  *plain <33>\nThere was the hart y-wont to have his flight,\nAnd over a brook, and so forth on his way.\nThis Duke will have a course at him or tway\nWith houndes, such as him lust* to command.                     *pleased\nAnd when this Duke was come to the laund,\nUnder the sun he looked, and anon\nHe was ware of Arcite and Palamon,\nThat foughte breme*, as it were bulles two.                    *fiercely\nThe brighte swordes wente to and fro\nSo hideously, that with the leaste stroke\nIt seemed that it woulde fell an oak,\nBut what they were, nothing yet he wote*.                          *knew\nThis Duke his courser with his spurres smote,\n*And at a start* he was betwixt them two,                     *suddenly*\nAnd pulled out a sword and cried, \"Ho!\nNo more, on pain of losing of your head.\nBy mighty Mars, he shall anon be dead\nThat smiteth any stroke, that I may see!\nBut tell to me what mister* men ye be,                *manner, kind <34>\nThat be so hardy for to fighte here\nWithoute judge or other officer,\nAs though it were in listes royally. <35>\nThis Palamon answered hastily,\nAnd saide: \"Sir, what needeth wordes mo'?\nWe have the death deserved bothe two,\nTwo woful wretches be we, and caitives,\nThat be accumbered* of our own lives,                          *burdened\nAnd as thou art a rightful lord and judge,\nSo give us neither mercy nor refuge.\nAnd slay me first, for sainte charity,\nBut slay my fellow eke as well as me.\nOr slay him first; for, though thou know it lite*,               *little\nThis is thy mortal foe, this is Arcite\nThat from thy land is banisht on his

*deceived\nAnd thou hast made of him thy chief esquier;\nAnd this is he, that loveth Emily.\nFor since the day is come that I shall die\nI make pleinly* my confession,                      *fully, unreservedly\nThat I am thilke* woful Palamon,                         *that same <36>\nThat hath thy prison broken wickedly.\nI am thy mortal foe, and it am I\nThat so hot loveth Emily the bright,\nThat I would die here present in her sight.\nTherefore I aske death and my jewise*.                        *judgement\nBut slay my fellow eke in the same wise,\nFor both we have deserved to be slain.\"\n\nThis worthy Duke answer'd anon again,\nAnd said, \"This is a short conclusion.\nYour own mouth, by your own confession\nHath damned you, and I will it record;\nIt needeth not to pain you with the cord;\nYe shall be dead, by mighty Mars the Red.<37>\n\nThe queen anon for very womanhead\nBegan to weep, and so did Emily,\nAnd all the ladies in the company.\nGreat pity was it as it thought them all,\nThat ever such a chance should befall,\nFor gentle men they were, of great estate,\nAnd nothing but for love was this debate\nThey saw their bloody woundes wide and sore,\nAnd cried all at once, both less and more,\n\"Have mercy, Lord, upon us women all.\"\nAnd on their bare knees adown they fall\nAnd would have kissed his feet there as he stood,\nTill at the last *aslaked was his mood*                   *his anger was\n(For pity runneth soon in gentle heart);                       appeased*\nAnd though at first for ire he quoke and start\nHe hath consider'd shortly in a clause\nThe trespass of them both, and eke the cause:\nAnd although that his ire their guilt accused\nYet in his reason he them both excused;\nAs thus; he thoughte well that every man\nWill help himself in love if that he can,\nAnd eke deliver himself out of prison.\nOf women, for they wepten ever-in-one:*                     *continually\nAnd eke his hearte had compassion\nAnd in his gentle heart he thought anon,\nAnd soft unto himself he saide: \"Fie\nUpon a lord that will have no mercy,\nBut be a lion both in word and deed,\nTo them that be in repentance and dread,\nAs well as-to a proud dispiteous* man                         *unpitying\nThat will maintaine what he first began.\nThat lord hath little of discretion,\nThat in such case *can no division*:           *can make no

*oftentimes*\nAnd thus with good hope and with hearte blithe\nThey take their leave, and homeward gan they ride\nTo Thebes-ward, with his old walles wide.\n\nI trow men woulde deem it negligence,\nIf I forgot to telle the dispence*                          *expenditure\nOf Theseus, that went so busily\nTo maken up the listes royally,\nThat such a noble theatre as it was,\nI dare well say, in all

white,\nWestward right such another opposite.\nAnd, shortly to conclude, such a place\nWas never on earth made in so little space,\nFor in the land there was no craftes-man,\nThat geometry or arsmetrike* can**,                   *arithmetic **knew\nNor pourtrayor*, nor carver of images,                 *portrait painter\nThat Theseus ne gave him meat and wages\nThe theatre to make and to devise.\nAnd for to do his rite and sacrifice\nHe eastward hath upon the gate above,\nIn worship of Venus, goddess of love,\n*Done make* an altar and an oratory;                 *caused to be made*\nAnd westward, in the mind and in memory\nOf Mars, he maked hath right such another,\nThat coste largely of gold a fother*.                    *a great amount\nAnd northward, in a turret on the wall,\nOf alabaster white and red coral\nAn oratory riche for to see,\nIn worship of Diane of chastity,\nHath Theseus done work in noble wise.\nBut yet had I forgotten to devise*                             *describe\nThe noble carving, and the portraitures,\nThe shape, the countenance of the figures\nThat weren in there oratories three.\n\nFirst in the temple of Venus may'st thou see\nWrought on the wall,  full piteous to behold,\nThe broken sleepes, and the sikes* cold,                         *sighes\nThe sacred teares, and the waimentings*,                     *lamentings\nThe fiery strokes of the desirings,\nThat Love's servants in this life endure;\nThe oathes, that their covenants assure.\nPleasance and Hope, Desire, Foolhardiness,\nBeauty and Youth, and Bawdry and Richess,\nCharms and Sorc'ry, Leasings* and Flattery,                  *falsehoods\nDispence, Business, and Jealousy,\nThat wore of yellow goldes* a garland,                  *sunflowers <40>\nAnd had a cuckoo sitting on her hand,\nFeasts, instruments, and caroles and dances,\nLust and array, and all the circumstances\nOf Love, which I reckon'd and reckon shall\nIn order, were painted on the wall,\nAnd more than I can make of mention.\nFor soothly all the mount of Citheron,<41>\nWhere Venus hath her principal dwelling,\nWas showed on the wall in pourtraying,\nWith all the garden, and the lustiness*.                   *pleasantness\nNor was forgot the porter Idleness,\nNor Narcissus the fair of *yore agone*,                    *olden times*\nNor yet the folly of King Solomon,\nNor yet the greate strength of Hercules,\nTh' enchantments of Medea and Circes,\nNor of Turnus the hardy fierce courage,\nThe rich Croesus *caitif in servage.* <42>         *abased into slavery*\nThus may ye see, that wisdom nor richess,\nBeauty, nor sleight, nor strength, nor hardiness\nNe may with Venus holde champartie*,            *divided possession <43>\nFor as her liste the world may she gie*.                          *guide\nLo, all these folk so caught were in her las*                     *snare\nTill they for woe full often said, Alas!\nSuffice these ensamples one or two,\nAlthough I could reckon a thousand mo'.\n\nThe statue of Venus, glorious to see\nWas naked floating in the large sea,\nAnd from the navel down all cover'd was\nWith waves green, and bright as any glass.\nA citole <44> in her right hand hadde she,\nAnd on her head, full seemly for to see,\nA rose garland fresh, and well smelling,\nAbove her head her doves flickering\nBefore her stood her sone Cupido,\nUpon his shoulders winges had he two;\nAnd blind he was, as it is often seen;\nA bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen.\n\nWhy should I not as well eke tell you all\nThe portraiture, that was upon the wall\nWithin the temple of mighty Mars the Red?\nAll painted was the wall in length and brede*                   *breadth\nLike to the estres* of the grisly place               *interior chambers\nThat hight the great temple of Mars in Thrace,\nIn thilke* cold and frosty region,                                 *that\nThere as Mars hath his sovereign mansion.\nIn which there dwelled neither man nor beast,\nWith knotty gnarry* barren trees old                            *gnarled\nOf stubbes sharp and hideous to behold;\nIn which there ran a rumble and a sough*,                *groaning noise\nAs though a storm should bursten every bough:\nAnd downward from an hill under a bent*                           *<DW72>\nThere stood the temple of Mars Armipotent,\nWrought all of burnish'd steel, of which th' entry\nWas long and strait, and ghastly for to see.\nAnd thereout came *a rage and such a vise*,       *such a furious voice*\nThat it made all the gates for to rise.\nThe northern light in at the doore shone,\nFor window on the walle was there none\nThrough which men mighten any light discern.\nThe doors were all of adamant etern,\nY-clenched *overthwart and ende-long*         *crossways and lengthways*\nWith iron tough, and, for to make it strong,\nEvery pillar the temple to sustain\nWas tunne-great*, of iron bright and sheen.     *thick as a tun (barrel)\nThere saw I first the dark imagining\nOf felony, and all the compassing;\nThe cruel ire, as red as any glede*,                          *live coal\nThe picke-purse<45>, and eke the pale dread;\nThe smiler with the knife under the cloak,\nThe shepen* burning with the blacke smoke                   *stable <46>\nThe treason of the murd'ring in the bed,\nThe open war, with woundes all be-bled;\nConteke* with bloody knife, and sharp menace.       *contention, discord\nAll full of chirking* was that sorry place.     *creaking, jarring noise\nThe slayer of himself eke saw I there,\nHis hearte-blood had bathed all his hair:\nThe nail y-driven in the shode* at night,         *hair of the head <47>\nThe colde death, with mouth gaping upright.\nAmiddes of the temple sat Mischance,\nWith discomfort and sorry countenance;\nEke saw I Woodness* laughing in his rage,                       *Madness\nArmed Complaint, Outhees*, and fierce Outrage;                   *Outcry\nThe carrain* in the bush, with throat y-corve**,       *corpse **slashed\nA thousand slain, and not *of qualm y-storve*;        *dead of sickness*\nThe tyrant, with the prey by force y-reft;\nThe town destroy'd, that there was nothing left.\nYet saw I brent* the shippes hoppesteres, <48>                    *burnt\nThe hunter strangled with the wilde bears:\nThe sow freting* the child right in the cradle;          *devouring <49>\nThe cook scalded, for all his longe ladle.\nNor was forgot, *by th'infortune of Mart*        *through the misfortune\nThe carter overridden with his cart;                             of war*\nUnder the wheel full low he lay adown.\nThere were also of Mars' division,\nThe armourer, the bowyer*, and the smith,                 *maker of bows\nThat forgeth sharp swordes on his stith*.                         *anvil\nAnd all above depainted in a tower\nSaw I Conquest, sitting in great honour,\nWith thilke* sharpe sword over his head                            *that\nHanging by a subtle y-twined thread.\nPainted the slaughter was of Julius<50>,\nOf cruel Nero, and Antonius:\nAlthough at that time they were yet unborn,\nYet was their death depainted there beforn,\nBy menacing of Mars, right by figure,\nSo was it showed in that portraiture,\nAs is depainted in the stars above,\nWho shall be slain, or elles dead for love.\nSufficeth one ensample in stories old,\nI may not reckon them all, though I wo'ld.\n\nThe statue of Mars upon a carte* stood                          *chariot\nArmed, and looked grim as he were wood*,                            *mad\nAnd over his head there shone two figures\nOf starres, that be cleped in scriptures,\nThat one Puella, that other Rubeus. <51>\nThis god of armes was arrayed thus:\nA wolf there stood before him at his feet\nWith eyen red, and of a man he eat:\nWith subtle pencil painted was this story,\nIn redouting* of Mars and of his glory.                 *reverance, fear\n\nNow to the temple of Dian the chaste\nAs shortly as I can I will me haste,\nTo telle you all the descriptioun.\nDepainted be the walles up and down\nOf hunting and of shamefast chastity.\nThere saw I how woful Calistope,<52>\nWhen that Dian aggrieved was with her,\nWas turned from a woman to a bear,\nAnd after was she made the lodestar*:                         *pole star\nThus was it painted, I can say no far*;                         *farther\nHer son is eke a star as men may see.\nThere saw I Dane <53> turn'd into a tree,\nI meane not the goddess Diane,\nBut Peneus' daughter, which that hight Dane.\nThere saw I Actaeon an hart y-maked*,                              *made\nFor vengeance that he saw Dian all naked:\nI saw how that his houndes have him caught,\nAnd freten* him, for that they

grove, sweet and green,                   *self-same\nThere as he had his amorous desires,\nHis complaint, and for love his hote fires,\nHe woulde make a fire*, in which th' office

*cause of anger\nThus endeth Palamon and Emily\nAnd God save all this faire company.\n\n\nNotes to The Knight's Tale.\n\n\n1. For the plan and principal incidents of the \"Knight's Tale,\"\nChaucer was indebted to Boccaccio, who had himself borrowed\nfrom some prior poet, chronicler, or romancer.  Boccaccio\nspeaks of the story as \"very ancient;\" and, though that may not\nbe proof of its antiquity, it certainly shows that he took it from\nan earlier writer. The \"Tale\" is more or less a paraphrase of\nBoccaccio's \"Theseida;\" but in some points the copy has a\ndistinct dramatic superiority over the original.  The \"Theseida\"\ncontained ten thousand lines; Chaucer has condensed it into less\nthan one-fourth of the number. The \"Knight's Tale\" is supposed\nto have been at first composed as a separate work; it is\nundetermined whether Chaucer took it direct from the Italian of\nBoccaccio, or from a French translation.\n\n2. Highte: was called; from the Anglo-Saxon \"hatan\", to bid or\ncall; German, \"Heissen\", \"heisst\".\n\n3. Feminie: The \"Royaume des Femmes\" -- kingdom of the\nAmazons. Gower, in the \"Confessio Amantis,\" styles\nPenthesilea the \"Queen of Feminie.\"\n\n4. Wonnen: Won, conquered; German \"gewonnen.\"\n\n5. Ear: To plough; Latin, \"arare.\"  \"I have abundant  matter for\ndiscourse.\" The first, and half of the second, of Boccaccio's\ntwelve books are disposed of in the few lines foregoing.\n\n6. Waimenting:  bewailing; German, \"wehklagen\"\n\n7. Starf: died; German, \"sterben,\" \"starb\".\n\n8. The Minotaur: The monster, half-man and half-bull, which\nyearly devoured a tribute of fourteen Athenian youths and\nmaidens, until it was slain by Theseus.\n\n9. Pillers: pillagers, strippers; French, \"pilleurs.\"\n\n10. The donjon was originally the central tower or \"keep\" of\nfeudal castles; it was employed to detain prisoners of\nimportance. Hence the modern meaning of the word dungeon.\n\n11. Saturn, in the old astrology, was a most unpropitious star to\nbe born under.\n\n12. To die in the pain was a proverbial expression in the French,\nused as an alternative to enforce a resolution or a promise.\nEdward III., according to Froissart, declared that he would\neither succeed in the war against France or die in the pain --\n\"Ou il mourroit en la peine.\" It was the fashion in those times to\nswear oaths of friendship and brotherhood; and hence, though\nthe fashion has long died out, we still speak of \"sworn friends.\"\n\n13. The saying of the old scholar Boethius, in his treatise \"De\nConsolatione Philosophiae\", which Chaucer translated, and\nfrom which he has freely borrowed in his poetry. The words are\n\"Quis legem det amantibus?\nMajor lex amor est sibi.\"\n(\"Who can give law to lovers? Love is a law unto himself, and\ngreater\")\n\n14. \"Perithous\" and \"Theseus\" must, for the metre, be\npronounced as words of four and three syllables respectively --\nthe vowels at the end not being diphthongated, but enunciated\nseparately, as if the words were printed Pe-ri-tho-us, The-se-us.\nThe same rule applies in such words as \"creature\" and\n\"conscience,\" which are trisyllables.\n\n15. Stound: moment, short space of time; from Anglo-Saxon,\n\"stund;\" akin to which is German, \"Stunde,\" an hour.\n\n16. Meinie: servants, or menials, &c., dwelling together in a\nhouse; from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning a crowd. Compare\nGerman, \"Menge,\" multitude.\n\n17. The pure fetters: the very fetters. The Greeks used\n\"katharos\", the Romans \"purus,\" in the same sense.\n\n18. In the medieval courts of Love, to which allusion is\nprobably made forty lines before, in the word \"parlement,\" or\n\"parliament,\" questions like that here proposed were seriously\ndiscussed.\n\n19. Gear: behaviour, fashion, dress; but, by another reading, the\nword is \"gyre,\" and means fit, trance -- from the Latin, \"gyro,\" I\nturn round.\n\n20. Before his head in his cell fantastic: in front of his head in\nhis cell of fantasy. \"The division of the brain into cells,\naccording to the different sensitive faculties,\" says Mr Wright,\n\"is very ancient, and is found depicted in mediaeval\nmanuscripts.\" In a manuscript in the Harleian Library, it is\nstated, \"Certum est in prora cerebri esse fantasiam, in medio\nrationem discretionis, in puppi memoriam\" (it is certain that in\nthe front of the brain is imagination, in the middle reason, in the\nback memory) -- a classification not materially differing from\nthat of modern phrenologists.\n\n21. Dan: Lord; Latin, \"Dominus;\" Spanish, \"Don.\"\n\n22. The \"caduceus.\"\n\n23. Argus was employed by Juno to watch Io with his hundred\neyes but he was sent to sleep by the flute of Mercury, who then\ncut off his head.\n\n24. Next: nearest; German, \"naechste\".\n\n25. Clary: hippocras, wine made with spices.\n\n26. Warray: make war; French \"guerroyer\", to molest; hence,\nperhaps, \"to worry.\"\n\n27. All day meeten men at unset steven: every day men meet at\nunexpected time.  \"To  set a steven,\" is to fix a time, make an\nappointment.\n\n28. Roundelay: song coming round again to the words with\nwhich it opened.\n\n29. Now in the crop and now down in the breres: Now in the\ntree-top, now down in the briars. \"Crop and root,\" top and\nbottom, is used to express the perfection or totality of anything.\n\n30. Beknow: avow, acknowledge: German, \"bekennen.\"\n\n31. Shapen was my death erst than my shert: My death was\ndecreed before my shirt ws shaped -- that is, before any clothes\nwere made for me, before my birth.\n\n32. Regne: Queen; French, \"Reine;\" Venus is meant. The\ncommon reading, however, is \"regne,\" reign or power.\n\n33. Launde: plain. Compare modern English, \"lawn,\" and\nFrench, \"Landes\" -- flat, bare marshy tracts in the south of\nFrance.\n\n34. Mister: manner, kind; German \"muster,\" sample, model.\n\n35. In listes:  in the lists, prepared for such single combats\nbetween champion and accuser, &c.\n\n36. Thilke: that, contracted from \"the ilke,\" the same.\n\n37. Mars the Red: referring to the ruddy colour of the planet, to\nwhich was doubtless due the transference to it of the name of\nthe God of War. In his \"Republic,\" enumerating the seven\nplanets, Cicero speaks of the propitious and beneficent light of\nJupiter: \"Tum (fulgor) rutilis horribilisque terris, quem Martium\ndicitis\" --  \"Then the red glow, horrible to the nations, which\nyou say to be that of Mars.\" Boccaccio opens the \"Theseida\" by\nan invocation to \"rubicondo Marte.\"\n\n38. Last: lace, leash, noose, snare: from Latin, \"laceus.\"\n\n39. \"Round was the shape, in manner of compass,\n     Full of degrees, the height of sixty pas\"\nThe building was a circle of steps or benches, as in the ancient\namphitheatre. Either the building was sixty paces high; or, more\nprobably, there were sixty of the steps or benches.\n\n40. Yellow goldes: The sunflower, turnsol, or girasol, which\nturns with and seems to watch the sun, as a jealous lover his\nmistress.\n\n41. Citheron: The Isle of Venus, Cythera, in the Aegean Sea;\nnow called Cerigo: not, as Chaucer's form of the word might\nimply, Mount Cithaeron, in the south-west of Boetia, which was\nappropriated to other deities than Venus -- to Jupiter, to\nBacchus, and the Muses.\n\n42. It need not be said that Chaucer pays slight heed to\nchronology in this passage, where the deeds of Turnus, the\nglory of King Solomon, and the fate of Croesus are made\nmemories of the far past in the time of fabulous Theseus, the\nMinotaur-slayer.\n\n43. Champartie: divided power or possession; an old law-term,\nsignifying the maintenance of a person in a law suit on the\ncondition of receiving part of the property in dispute, if\nrecovered.\n\n44. Citole: a kind of dulcimer.\n\n45. The picke-purse:  The plunderers that followed armies, and\ngave to war a horror all their own.\n\n46. Shepen: stable;  Anglo-Saxon, \"scypen;\" the word\n\"sheppon\" still survives in provincial parlance.\n\n47. This line, perhaps, refers to the deed of Jael.\n\n48. The shippes hoppesteres: The meaning is dubious. We may\nunderstand \"the dancing ships,\" \"the ships that hop\" on the\nwaves; \"steres\" being taken as the feminine adjectival\ntermination: or we may, perhaps, read, with one of the\nmanuscripts, \"the ships upon the steres\" -- that is, even as they\nare being steered, or on the open sea -- a more picturesque\nnotion.\n\n49. Freting: devouring; the Germans use \"Fressen\" to mean\neating by animals, \"essen\" by men.\n\n50. Julius: i.e. Julius Caesar\n\n51. Puella and Rubeus were two figures in geomancy,\nrepresenting two constellations-the one signifying Mars\nretrograde, the other Mars direct.\n\n52. Calistope: or Callisto, daughter of Lycaon, seduced by\nJupiter, turned into a bear by Diana, and placed afterwards, with\nher son, as the Great Bear among the stars.\n\n53. Dane: Daphne, daughter of the river-god Peneus, in\nThessaly; she was beloved by Apollo, but to avoid his pursuit,\nshe was, at her own prayer, changed into a laurel-tree.\n\n54. As the goddess of Light, or the goddess who brings to light,\nDiana -- as well as Juno -- was invoked by women in childbirth:\nso Horace, Odes iii. 22, says:--\n\n\"Montium custos nemorumque, Virgo,\nQuae laborantes utero puellas\nTer vocata audis adimisque leto,\nDiva triformis.\"\n\n(\"Virgin custodian of hills and groves, three-formed goddess\nwho hears and saves from death young women who call upon\nher thrice when in childbirth\")\n\n55. Every deal:  in every part; \"deal\" corresponds to the\nGerman \"Theil\" a portion.\n\n56. Sikerly: surely; German, \"sicher;\" Scotch, \"sikkar,\" certain.\nWhen Robert Bruce had escaped from England to assume the\nScottish crown, he stabbed Comyn before the altar at Dumfries;\nand, emerging from the church, was asked by his friend\nKirkpatrick if he had slain the traitor. \"I doubt it,\" said Bruce.\n\"Doubt,\" cried Kirkpatrick.  \"I'll mak sikkar;\" and he rushed\ninto the church, and despatched Comyn with repeated thrusts of\nhis dagger.\n\n57. Kemped: combed; the word survives in \"unkempt.\"\n\n58. Alauns: greyhounds, mastiffs; from the Spanish word\n\"Alano,\" signifying a mastiff.\n\n59. Y-ment: mixed; German, \"mengen,\" to mix.\n\n60. Prime: The time of early prayers, between six and nine in\nthe morning.\n\n61. On the dais: see note 32 to the Prologue.\n\n62. In her hour: in the hour of the day (two hours before\ndaybreak) which after the astrological system that divided the\ntwenty-four among the seven ruling planets, was under the\ninfluence of Venus.\n\n63. Adon: Adonis, a beautiful youth beloved of Venus, whose\ndeath by the tusk of a boar she deeply mourned.\n\n64. The third hour unequal: In the third planetary hour;\nPalamon had gone forth in the hour of Venus, two hours before\ndaybreak; the hour of Mercury intervened; the third hour was\nthat of Luna, or Diana.  \"Unequal\" refers to the astrological\ndivision of day and night, whatever their duration, into twelve\nparts, which of necessity varied in length with the season.\n\n65. Smoking: draping; hence the word \"smock;\" \"smokless,\" in\nChaucer, means naked.\n\n66. Cerrial: of the species of oak which Pliny, in his \"Natural\nHistory,\" calls \"cerrus.\"\n\n67. Stace of Thebes: Statius, the Roman who embodied in the\ntwelve books of his \"Thebaid\" the ancient legends connected\nwith the war of the seven against Thebes.\n\n68. Diana was Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Hecate in\nhell; hence the direction of the eyes of her statue to \"Pluto's\ndark region.\"  Her statue was set up where three ways met, so\nthat with a different face she looked down each of the three;\nfrom which she was called Trivia. See the quotation from\nHorace, note 54.\n\n69. Las: net; the invisible toils in which Hephaestus caught Ares\nand the faithless Aphrodite, and exposed them to the\n\"inextinguishable laughter\" of Olympus.\n\n70. Saturnus the cold: Here, as in \"Mars the Red\" we have the\nperson of the deity endowed with the supposed quality of the\nplanet called after his name.\n\n71. The astrologers ascribed great power to Saturn, and\npredicted \"much debate\" under his ascendancy; hence it was\n\"against his kind\" to compose the heavenly strife.\n\n72. Ayel: grandfather; French \"Aieul\".\n\n73. Testers: Helmets; from the French \"teste\", \"tete\", head.\n\n74. Parements: ornamental garb, French \"parer\" to deck.\n\n75. Gniding: Rubbing, polishing; Anglo-Saxon \"gnidan\", to rub.\n\n76. Nakeres: Drums, used in the cavalry; Boccaccio's word is\n\"nachere\".\n\n77. Made an O: Ho! Ho! to command attention; like \"oyez\", the\ncall for silence in law-courts or before proclamations.\n\n78. Sarge: serge, a coarse woollen cloth\n\n79. Heart-spoon: The concave part of the breast, where the\nlower ribs join the cartilago ensiformis.\n\n80. To-hewen and to-shred:  \"to\" before a verb implies\nextraordinary violence in the action denoted.\n\n81. He through the thickest of the throng etc.. \"He\" in this\npassage refers impersonally to any of the combatants.\n\n82. Galaphay: Galapha, in Mauritania.\n\n83. Belmarie is supposed to have been a Moorish state in\nAfrica; but \"Palmyrie\" has been suggested as the correct\nreading.\n\n84. As I came never I cannot telle where: Where it went I\ncannot tell you, as I was not there.  Tyrwhitt thinks that\nChaucer is sneering at Boccacio's pompous account of the\npassage of Arcite's soul to heaven. Up to this point, the\ndescription of the death-scene is taken literally from the\n\"Theseida.\"\n\n85. With sluttery beard, and ruggy ashy hairs: With neglected\nbeard, and rough hair strewn with ashes. \"Flotery\" is the general\nreading; but \"sluttery\" seems to be more in keeping with the\npicture of abandonment to grief.\n\n86. Master street: main street; so Froissart speaks of \"le\nsouverain carrefour.\"\n\n87. Y-wrie: covered, hid; Anglo-Saxon, \"wrigan,\" to veil.\n\n88. Emily applied the funeral torch. The \"guise\" was, among the\nancients, for the nearest relative of the deceased to do this, with\naverted face.\n\n89. It was the custom for soldiers to march thrice around the\nfuneral pile of an emperor or general; \"on the left hand\" is\nadded, in reference to the belief that the left hand was\npropitious -- the Roman augur turning his face southward, and\nso placing on his left hand the east, whence good omens came.\nWith the Greeks, however, their augurs facing the north, it was\njust the contrary. The confusion, frequent in classical writers, is\ncomplicated here by the fact that Chaucer's description of the\nfuneral of Arcite is taken from Statius' \"Thebaid\" -- from a\nRoman's account of a Greek solemnity.\n\n90. Lyke-wake: watching by the remains of the dead; from\nAnglo-Saxon, \"lice,\" a corpse; German, \"Leichnam.\"\n\n91. Chaucer here borrows from Boethius, who says:\n\"Hanc rerum seriem ligat,\nTerras ac pelagus regens,\nEt coelo imperitans, amor.\"\n(Love ties these things together: the earth, and the ruling sea,\nand the imperial heavens)\n\n\n\nTHE MILLER'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\nWhen that the Knight had thus his tale told\nIn all the rout was neither young nor old,\nThat he not said it was a noble story,\nAnd worthy to be *drawen to memory*;                          *recorded*\nAnd *namely the gentles* every one.          *especially the gentlefolk*\nOur Host then laugh'd and swore, \"So may I gon,*                *prosper\nThis goes aright; *unbuckled is the mail;*        *the budget is opened*\nLet see now who shall tell another tale:\nFor truely this game is well begun.\nNow telleth ye, Sir Monk, if that ye conne*,                       *know\nSomewhat, to quiten* with the Knighte's tale.\"                    *match\nThe Miller that fordrunken was all pale,\nSo that unnethes* upon his horse he sat,                *with difficulty\nHe would avalen* neither hood nor hat,                          *uncover\nNor abide* no man for his courtesy,                         *give way to\nBut in Pilate's voice<1> he gan to cry,\nAnd swore by armes, and by blood, and bones,\n\"I can a noble tale for the nones*                            *occasion,\nWith which I will now quite* the Knighte's tale.\"                 *match\nOur Host saw well how drunk he was of ale,\nAnd said; \"Robin, abide, my leve* brother,                         *dear\nSome better man shall tell us first another:\nAbide, and let us worke thriftily.\"\nBy Godde's soul,\" quoth he, \"that will not I,\nFor I will speak, or elles go my way!\"\nOur Host answer'd; \"*Tell on a devil way*;             *devil take you!*\nThou art a fool; thy wit is overcome.\"\n\"Now hearken,\" quoth the Miller, \"all and some:\nBut first I make a protestatioun.\nThat I am drunk, I know it by my soun':\nAnd therefore if that I misspeak or say,\n*Wite it* the ale of Southwark, I you pray:             *blame it on*<2>\nFor I will tell a legend and a life\nBoth of a carpenter and of his wife,\nHow that a clerk hath *set the wrighte's cap*.\"   *fooled the carpenter*\nThe Reeve answer'd and saide, \"*Stint thy clap*,      *hold your tongue*\nLet be thy lewed drunken harlotry.\nIt is a sin, and eke a great folly\nTo apeiren* any man, or him defame,                              *injure\nAnd eke to bringe wives in evil name.\nThou may'st enough of other thinges sayn.\"\nThis drunken Miller spake full soon again,\nAnd saide, \"Leve brother Osewold,\nWho hath no wife, he is no cuckold.\nBut I say not therefore that thou art one;\nThere be full goode wives many one.\nWhy art thou angry with my tale now?\nI have a wife, pardie, as well as thou,\nYet *n'old I*, for the oxen in my plough,                  *I would not*\nTaken upon me more than enough,\nTo deemen* of myself that I am one;                               *judge\nI will believe well that I am none.\nAn husband should not be inquisitive\nOf Godde's privity, nor of his wife.\nSo he may finde Godde's foison* there,                         *treasure\nOf the remnant needeth not to enquere.\"\n\nWhat should I more say, but that this Millere\nHe would his wordes for no man forbear,\nBut told his churlish* tale in his mannere;               *boorish, rude\nMe thinketh, that I shall rehearse it here.\nAnd therefore every gentle wight I pray,\nFor Godde's love to deem not that I say\nOf evil intent, but that I must rehearse\nTheir tales all, be they better or worse,\nOr elles falsen* some of my mattere.                            *falsify\nAnd therefore whoso list it not to hear,\nTurn o'er the leaf, and choose another tale;\nFor he shall find enough, both great and smale,\nOf storial* thing that toucheth gentiless,             *historical, true\nAnd eke morality and holiness.\nBlame not me, if that ye choose amiss.\nThe Miller is a churl, ye know well this,\nSo was the Reeve, with many other mo',\nAnd harlotry* they tolde bothe two.                        *ribald tales\n*Avise you* now, and put me out of blame;                    *be warned*\nAnd eke men should not make earnest of game*.                 *jest, fun\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Miller's Tale\n\n1.

Astrolabe:  \"Astrelagour,\" \"astrelabore\"; a mathematical\ninstrument for taking the altitude of the sun or stars.\n\n3. \"Augrim\" is a corruption of algorithm, the Arabian term for\nnumeration; \"augrim stones,\" therefore were probably marked\nwith numerals, and used as counters.\n\n4. Angelus ad virginem: The Angel's salutation to Mary; Luke i.\n28.  It was the \"Ave Maria\" of the Catholic Church service.\n\n5. Cato: Though Chaucer may have referred to the famous\nCensor, more probably the reference is merely to the \"Moral\nDistichs,\" which go under his name, though written after his\ntime; and in a supplement to which the quoted passage may be\nfound.\n\n6. Barm-cloth: apron; from Anglo-Saxon \"barme,\" bosom or\nlap.\n\n7. Volupere: Head-gear, kerchief; from French, \"envelopper,\"\nto wrap up.\n\n8. Popelet:  Puppet; but chiefly; young wench.\n\n9. Noble: nobles were gold coins of especial purity and\nbrightness; \"Ex auro nobilissimi, unde nobilis vocatus,\" (made\nfrom the noblest (purest) gold, and therefore called nobles) says\nVossius.\n\n10. Yern: Shrill, lively; German, \"gern,\" willingly, cheerfully.\n\n11. Braket:  bragget, a sweet drink made of honey, spices, &c.\nIn some parts of the country, a drink made from honeycomb,\nafter the honey is extracted, is still called \"bragwort.\"\n\n12. Piggesnie: a fond term, like \"my duck;\" from Anglo-Saxon,\n\"piga,\" a young maid; but Tyrwhitt associates it with the Latin,\n\"ocellus,\" little eye, a fondling term, and suggests that the \"pigs-\neye,\" which is very small, was  applied in the same sense.\nDavenport and Butler both use the word pigsnie, the first for\n\"darling,\" the second literally for \"eye;\" and Bishop Gardner,\n\"On True Obedience,\" in his address to the reader, says: \"How\nsoftly she was wont to chirpe him under the chin, and kiss him;\nhow prettily she could talk to him (how doth my sweet heart,\nwhat saith now pig's-eye).\"\n\n13. Oseney: A once well-known abbey near Oxford.\n\n14. Trave: travis; a frame in which unruly  horses were shod.\n\n15. Harow and Alas:  Haro! was an old Norman cry for redress\nor aid.

Because she was town-bred, he offered wealth, or money\nreward, for her love.\n\n22. Parish-clerks, like Absolon, had leading parts in the\nmysteries or religious plays; Herod was one of these parts,\nwhich may have been an object of competition among the\namateurs of the period.\n\n23 .\"The nighe sly maketh oft time the far lief to be loth\": a\nproverb; the cunning one near at hand oft makes the loving one\nafar off to be odious.\n\n24. Kyked: Looked; \"keek\" is still used in some parts in the\nsense of \"peep.\"\n\n25. Saint Frideswide was the patroness of a considerable priory\nat Oxford, and held there in high repute.\n\n26.

Forlore: lost; german, \"verloren.\"\n\n29.

According to the old mysteries, Noah's wife refused to\ncome into the ark, and bade her husband row forth and get him\na new wife, because he was leaving her gossips in the town to\ndrown. Shem and his brothers got her shipped by main force;\nand Noah, coming forward to welcome her, was greeted with a\nbox on the ear.\n\n31. \"Him had been lever, I dare well undertake,\n     At thilke time, than all his wethers black,\n     That she had had a ship herself alone.\"\ni.e.\n\"At that time he would have given all his black wethers, if she\nhad had an ark to herself.\"\n\n32. \"Clum,\" like \"mum,\" a note of silence; but otherwise\nexplained as the humming sound made in repeating prayers;\nfrom the Anglo-Saxon, \"clumian,\" to mutter, speak in an under-\ntone, keep silence.\n\n33. Curfew-time: Eight in the evening, when, by the law of\nWilliam the Conqueror, all people were, on ringing of a bell, to\nextinguish fire and candle, and go to rest; hence the word\ncurfew, from French, \"couvre-feu,\" cover-fire.\n\n34. Absolon chewed grains: these were grains of Paris, or\nParadise; a favourite spice.\n\n35. Under his tongue a true love he bare:  some sweet herb;\nanother reading, however, is \"a true love-knot,\" which may\nhave been of the nature of a charm.\n\n36. The two lines within brackets are not in most of the\neditions: they are taken from Urry; whether he supplied them or\nnot, they serve the purpose of a necessary explanation.\n\n37. Gay girl: As applied to a young woman of light manners,\nthis euphemistic phrase has enjoyed a wonderful vitality.\n\n38. Viretote: Urry reads \"meritote,\" and explains it from\nSpelman as a game in which children made themselves giddy by\nwhirling on ropes.  In French, \"virer\" means to turn; and the\nexplanation may, therefore, suit either reading. In modern slang\nparlance, Gerveis would probably have said, \"on the rampage,\"\nor \"on the swing\" -- not very far from Spelman's rendering.\n\n39. He had more tow on his distaff: a proverbial saying: he was\nplaying a deeper game, had more serious business on hand.\n\n40. Ere: before; German, \"eher.\"\n\n41. Sell:  sill of the door, threshold; French, \"seuil,\" Latin,\n\"solum,\" the ground.\n\n\n\nTHE REEVE'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\nWHEN folk had laughed all at this nice case\nOf Absolon and Hendy Nicholas,\nDiverse folk diversely they said,\nBut for the more part they laugh'd and play'd;*           *were diverted\nAnd at this tale I saw no man him grieve,\nBut it were only Osewold the Reeve.\nBecause he was of carpenteres craft,\nA little ire is in his hearte laft*;                               *left\nHe gan to grudge* and blamed it a lite.**              *murmur **little.\n\"So the* I,\"  quoth he, \"full well could I him quite**   *thrive **match\nWith blearing* of a proude miller's eye,                    *dimming <1>\nIf that me list to speak of ribaldry.\nBut I am old; me list not play for age; <2>\nGrass time is done, my fodder is now forage.\nThis white top* writeth mine olde years;                           *head\nMine heart is also moulded* as mine hairs;                 *grown mouldy\nAnd I do fare as doth an open-erse*;                         *medlar <3>\nThat ilke* fruit is ever longer werse,                             *same\nTill it be rotten *in mullok or in stre*.    *on the ground or in straw*\nWe olde men, I dread, so fare we;\nTill we be rotten, can we not be ripe;\nWe hop* away, while that the world will pipe;                     *dance\nFor in our will there sticketh aye a nail,\nTo have an hoary head and a green tail,\nAs hath a leek; for though our might be gone,\nOur will desireth folly ever-in-one*:                       *continually\nFor when we may not do, then will we speak,\nYet in our ashes cold does fire reek.*                         *smoke<4>\nFour gledes* have we, which I shall devise**,         *coals ** describe\nVaunting, and lying, anger, covetise*.                     *covetousness\nThese foure sparks belongen unto eld.\nOur olde limbes well may be unweld*,                           *unwieldy\nBut will shall never fail us, that is sooth.\nAnd yet have I alway a coltes tooth,<5>\nAs many a year as it is passed and gone\nSince that my tap of life began to run;\nFor sickerly*, when I was born, anon                          *certainly\nDeath drew the tap of life, and let it gon:\nAnd ever since hath so the tap y-run,\nTill that almost all empty is the tun.\nThe stream of life now droppeth on the chimb.<6>\nThe silly tongue well may ring and chime\nOf wretchedness, that passed is full yore*:                        *long\nWith olde folk, save dotage, is no more. <7>\n\nWhen that our Host had heard this sermoning,\nHe gan to speak as lordly as a king,\nAnd said; \"To what amounteth all this wit?\nWhat? shall we speak all day of holy writ?\nThe devil made a Reeve for to preach,\nAs of a souter* a shipman, or a leach**.                    *cobbler <8>\nSay forth thy tale, and tarry not the time:                **surgeon <9>\nLo here is Deptford, and 'tis half past prime:<10>\nLo Greenwich, where many a shrew is in.\nIt were high time thy tale to begin.\"\n\n\"Now, sirs,\" quoth then this Osewold the Reeve,\nI pray you all that none of you do grieve,\nThough I answer, and somewhat set his hove*,                  *hood <11>\nFor lawful is *force off with force to shove.*           *to repel force\nThis drunken miller hath y-told us here                        by force*\nHow that beguiled was a carpentere,\nParaventure* in scorn, for I am one:                            *perhaps\nAnd, by your leave, I shall him quite anon.\nRight in his churlish termes will I speak,\nI pray to God his necke might to-break.\nHe can well in mine eye see a stalk,\nBut in his own he cannot see a balk.\"<12>\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Reeves Tale.\n\n\n 1. \"With blearing of a proude miller's eye\": dimming his eye;\nplaying off a joke on him.\n\n2. \"Me list not play for age\": age takes away my zest for\ndrollery.\n\n3.

The Cook's Tale is unfinished in all the manuscripts; but in\nsome, of minor authority, the Cook is made to break off his\ntale, because \"it is so foul,\" and to tell the story of Gamelyn, on\nwhich Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" is founded. The story is\nnot Chaucer's, and is different in metre, and inferior in\ncomposition to the Tales. It is supposed that Chaucer expunged\nthe Cook's Tale for the same reason that made him on his death-\nbed lament that he had written so much \"ribaldry.\"\n\n\n\nTHE MAN OF LAW'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\nOur Hoste saw well that the brighte sun\nTh' arc of his artificial day had run\nThe fourthe part, and half an houre more;\nAnd, though he were not deep expert in lore,\nHe wist it was the eight-and-twenty day\nOf April, that is messenger to May;\nAnd saw well that the shadow of every tree\nWas in its length of the same quantity\nThat was the body erect that caused it;\nAnd therefore by the shadow he took his wit*,                 *knowledge\nThat Phoebus, which that shone so clear and bright,\nDegrees was five-and-forty clomb on height;\nAnd for that day, as in that latitude,\nIt was ten of the clock, he gan conclude;\nAnd suddenly he plight* his horse about.                     *pulled <1>\n\n\"Lordings,\" quoth he, \"I warn you all this rout*,               *company\nThe fourthe partie of this day is gone.\nNow for the love of God and of Saint John\nLose no time, as farforth as ye may.\nLordings, the time wasteth night and day,\nAnd steals from us, what privily sleeping,\nAnd what through negligence in our waking,\nAs doth the stream, that turneth never again,\nDescending from the mountain to the plain.\nWell might Senec, and many a philosopher,\nBewaile time more than gold in coffer.\nFor loss of chattels may recover'd be,\nBut loss of time shendeth* us, quoth he.                       *destroys\n\nIt will not come again, withoute dread,*\nNo more than will Malkin's maidenhead,<2>\nWhen she hath lost it in her wantonness.\nLet us not moulde thus in idleness.\n\"Sir Man of Law,\" quoth he, \"so have ye bliss,\nTell us a tale anon, as forword* is.                        *the bargain\nYe be submitted through your free assent\nTo stand in this case at my judgement.\nAcquit you now, and *holde your behest*;             *keep your promise*\nThen have ye done your devoir* at the least.\"                      *duty\n\"Hoste,\" quoth he, \"de par dieux jeo asente; <3>\nTo breake forword is not mine intent.\nBehest is debt, and I would hold it fain,\nAll my behest; I can no better sayn.\nFor such law as a man gives another wight,\nHe should himselfe usen it by right.\nThus will our text: but natheless certain\nI can right now no thrifty* tale sayn,                           *worthy\nBut Chaucer (though he *can but lewedly*         *knows but imperfectly*\nOn metres and on rhyming craftily)\nHath said them, in such English as he can,\nOf olde time, as knoweth many a man.\nAnd if he have not said them, leve* brother,                       *dear\nIn one book, he hath said them in another\nFor he hath told of lovers up and down,\nMore than Ovide made of mentioun\nIn his Epistolae, that be full old.\nWhy should I telle them, since they he told?\nIn youth he made of Ceyx and Alcyon,<4>\nAnd since then he hath spoke of every one\nThese noble wives, and these lovers eke.\nWhoso that will his large volume seek\nCalled the Saintes' Legend of Cupid:<5>\nThere may he see the large woundes wide\nOf Lucrece, and of Babylon Thisbe;\nThe sword of Dido for the false Enee;\nThe tree of Phillis for her Demophon;\nThe plaint of Diane, and of Hermion,\nOf Ariadne, and Hypsipile;\nThe barren isle standing in the sea;\nThe drown'd Leander for his fair Hero;\nThe teares of Helene, and eke the woe\nOf Briseis, and Laodamia;\nThe cruelty of thee, Queen Medea,\nThy little children hanging by the halse*,                         *neck\nFor thy Jason, that was of love so false.\nHypermnestra, Penelop', Alcest',\nYour wifehood he commendeth with the best.\nBut certainly no worde writeth he\nOf *thilke wick'* example of Canace,                       *that wicked*\nThat loved her own brother sinfully;\n(Of all such cursed stories I say, Fy),\nOr else of Tyrius Apollonius,\nHow that the cursed king Antiochus\nBereft his daughter of her maidenhead;\nThat is so horrible a tale to read,\nWhen he her threw upon the pavement.\nAnd therefore he, *of full avisement*,         *deliberately, advisedly*\nWould never write in none of his sermons\nOf such unkind* abominations;                                 *unnatural\nNor I will none rehearse, if that I may.\nBut of my tale how shall I do this day?\nMe were loth to be liken'd doubteless\nTo Muses, that men call Pierides<6>\n(Metamorphoseos <7> wot what I mean),\nBut natheless I recke not a bean,\nThough I come after him with hawebake*;                        *lout <8>\nI speak in prose, and let him rhymes make.\"\nAnd with that word, he with a sober cheer\nBegan his tale, and said as ye shall hear.\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to The Man of Law's Tale\n\n\n1.

The Saintes Legend of Cupid: Now called \"The Legend of\nGood Women\".

Not the Muses, who had their surname from the place near\nMount Olympus where the Thracians first worshipped them; but\nthe nine daughters of Pierus, king of Macedonia, whom he\ncalled the nine Muses, and who, being conquered in a contest\nwith the genuine sisterhood, were changed into birds.\n\n7. Metamorphoseos:  Ovid's.\n\n8. Hawebake: hawbuck, country lout; the common proverbial\nphrase, \"to put a rogue above a gentleman,\" may throw light on\nthe reading here, which is difficult.\n\n\nTHE TALE. <1>\n\n\nO scatheful

This tale is believed by Tyrwhitt to have been taken, with no\nmaterial change, from the \"Confessio Amantis\" of John Gower,\nwho was contemporary with Chaucer, though somewhat his\nsenior.  In the prologue, the references to the stories of Canace,\nand of Apollonius Tyrius, seem to be an attack on Gower, who\nhad given these tales in his book; whence Tyrwhitt concludes\nthat the friendship between the two poets suffered some\ninterruption in the latter part of their lives.  Gower was not the\ninventor of the story, which he found in old French romances,\nand it is not improbable that Chaucer may have gone to the\nsame source as Gower, though the latter undoubtedly led the\nway.\n(Transcriber's note: later commentators have identified the\nintroduction describing the sorrows of poverty, along with the\nother moralising interludes in the tale, as translated from \"De\nContemptu Mundi\" (\"On the contempt of the world\") by Pope\nInnocent.)\n\n2. Transcriber' note: This refers to the game of hazard, a dice\ngame like craps, in which two  (\"ambes ace\") won,  and eleven\n(\"six-cinque\") lost.\n\n3. Purpose: discourse, tale: French \"propos\".\n\n4. \"Peace\" rhymed with \"lese\" and \"chese\", the old forms of\n\"lose\" and \"choose\".\n\n5. According to Middle Age writers there were two motions of\nthe first heaven; one everything always from east to west above\nthe stars; the other moving the stars against the first motion,\nfrom west to east, on two other poles.\n\n6. Atyzar: the meaning of this word is not known; but \"occifer\",\nmurderer, has been suggested instead by Urry, on the authority\nof a marginal reading on a manuscript.\n(Transcriber's note: later commentators explain it as derived\nfrom Arabic \"al-ta'thir\", influence - used here in an astrological\nsense)\n\n7. \"Thou knittest thee where thou art not receiv'd,\n    Where thou wert well, from thennes art thou weiv'd\"\ni.e.\n\"Thou joinest thyself where thou art rejected, and art declined\nor departed from the place where thou wert well.\"  The moon\nportends the fortunes of Constance.\n\n8. Fand: endeavour; from Anglo-Saxon, \"fandian,\" to try\n\n9. Feng: take; Anglo-Saxon \"fengian\", German, \"fangen\".\n\n10. Him and her on which thy limbes faithfully extend: those\nwho in faith wear the crucifix.\n\n11. The four spirits of tempest: the four angels who held the\nfour winds of the earth and to whom it was given to hurt the\nearth and the sea (Rev. vii. 1, 2).\n\n12. Thennes would it not in all a tide: thence would it not move\nfor long, at all.\n\n13. A manner Latin corrupt: a kind of bastard Latin.\n\n14. Knave child: male child; German \"Knabe\".\n\n15. Heried: honoured, praised; from Anglo-Saxon, \"herian.\"\nCompare German, \"herrlich,\" glorious, honourable.\n\n16. Beknow:  confess; German, \"bekennen.\"\n\n17. The poet here refers to Gower's version of the story.\n\n18. Stound: short time; German, \"stunde\", hour.\n\n19. Gestes: histories, exploits; Latin, \"res gestae\".\n\n\n\nTHE WIFE OF BATH'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE. <1>\n\n\nExperience, though none authority*                  *authoritative texts\nWere in this world, is right enough for me\nTo speak of woe that is in marriage:\nFor, lordings, since I twelve year was of age,\n(Thanked be God that *is etern on live),*              *lives eternally*\nHusbands at the church door have I had five,<2>\nFor I so often have y-wedded be,\nAnd all were worthy men in their degree.\nBut me was told, not longe time gone is\nThat sithen* Christe went never but ones                          *since\nTo wedding, in the Cane* of Galilee,                               *Cana\nThat by that ilk* example taught he me,                            *same\nThat I not wedded shoulde be but once.\nLo, hearken eke a sharp word for the nonce,*                   *occasion\nBeside a welle Jesus, God and man,\nSpake in reproof of the Samaritan:\n\"Thou hast y-had five husbandes,\" said he;\n\"And thilke* man, that now hath wedded thee,                       *that\nIs not thine husband:\" <3> thus said he certain;\nWhat that he meant thereby, I cannot sayn.\nBut that I aske, why the fifthe man\nWas not husband to the Samaritan?\nHow many might she have in marriage?\nYet heard I never tellen *in mine age*                      *in my life*\nUpon this number definitioun.\nMen may divine, and glosen* up and down;                        *comment\nBut well I wot, express without a lie,\nGod bade us for to wax and multiply;\nThat gentle text can I well understand.\nEke well I wot, he said, that mine husband\nShould leave father and mother, and take to me;\nBut of no number mention made he,\nOf bigamy or of octogamy;\nWhy then should men speak of it villainy?*     *as if it were a disgrace\n\nLo here, the wise king Dan* Solomon,                           *Lord <4>\nI trow that he had wives more than one;\nAs would to God it lawful were to me\nTo be refreshed half so oft as he!\nWhat gift* of God had he for all his wives?     *special favour, licence\nNo man hath such, that in this world alive is.\nGod wot, this noble king, *as to my wit,*              *as I understand*\nThe first night had many a merry fit\nWith each of them, so *well was him on live.*         *so well he lived*\nBlessed be God that I have wedded five!\nWelcome the sixth whenever that he shall.\nFor since I will not keep me chaste in all,\nWhen mine husband is from the world y-gone,\nSome Christian man shall wedde me anon.\nFor then th' apostle saith that I am free\nTo wed, *a' God's half,* where it liketh me.             *on God's part*\nHe saith, that to be wedded is no sin;\nBetter is to be wedded than to brin.*                              *burn\nWhat recketh* me though folk say villainy**                 *care **evil\nOf shrewed* Lamech, and his bigamy?                     *impious, wicked\nI wot well Abraham was a holy man,\nAnd Jacob eke, as far as ev'r I can.*                              *know\nAnd each of them had wives more than two;\nAnd many another holy man also.\nWhere can ye see, *in any manner age,*                   *in any period*\nThat highe God defended* marriage                           *forbade <5>\nBy word express?

out of his book a leaf,\nThat of the stroke mine eare wax'd all deaf.\nStubborn I was, as is a lioness,\nAnd of my tongue a very jangleress,*                             *prater\nAnd walk I would, as I had done beforn,\nFrom house to house, although he had it sworn:*            *had sworn to\nFor which he oftentimes woulde preach                         prevent it\nAnd me of olde Roman gestes*

**saw\nLooking out at his door upon a day.\nAnother Roman <27> told he me by name,\nThat, for his wife was at a summer game\nWithout his knowing, he forsook her eke.\nAnd then would he upon his Bible seek\nThat ilke* proverb of Ecclesiast,                                  *same\nWhere he commandeth, and forbiddeth fast,\nMan shall not suffer his wife go roll about.\nThen would he say right thus withoute doubt:\n\"Whoso that buildeth his house all of sallows,*                 *willows\nAnd pricketh his blind horse over the fallows,\nAnd suff'reth his wife to *go seeke hallows,*         *make

corrected be.\nI hate them that my vices telle me,\nAnd so do more of us (God wot) than I.\nThis made him wood* with me all utterly;                        *furious\nI woulde not forbear* him in no

night and day\nFor his disport he would it read alway;\nHe call'd it Valerie,<28> and Theophrast,\nAnd with that book he laugh'd alway full fast.\nAnd eke there was a clerk sometime at Rome,\nA cardinal, that highte Saint Jerome,\nThat made a book against Jovinian,\nWhich book was there; and eke Tertullian,\nChrysippus, Trotula, and Heloise,\nThat was an abbess not far from Paris;\nAnd eke the Parables* of Solomon,                              *Proverbs\nOvide's Art, <29> and bourdes* many one;                          *jests\nAnd alle these were bound in one volume.\nAnd every night and day was his custume\n(When he had leisure and vacation\nFrom other worldly occupation)\nTo readen in this book of wicked wives.\nHe knew of them more legends and more lives\nThan be of goodde wives in the Bible.\nFor, trust me well, it is an impossible\nThat any clerk will speake good of wives,\n(*But if* it be of holy saintes' lives)                          *unless\nNor of none other woman never the mo'.\nWho painted the lion, tell it me, who?\nBy God, if women haddde written stories,\nAs clerkes have within their oratories,\nThey would have writ of men more wickedness\nThan all

with his hearte-blood again.\nLo here express of women may ye find\nThat woman was the loss of all mankind.\nThen read he me how Samson lost his hairs\nSleeping, his leman cut them with her shears,\nThrough whiche treason lost he both his eyen.\nThen read he me, if that I shall not lien,\nOf Hercules, and of his Dejanire,\nThat caused him to set himself on fire.\nNothing forgot he of the care and woe\nThat Socrates had with his wives two;\nHow Xantippe cast piss upon his head.\nThis silly man sat still, as he were dead,\nHe wip'd his head, and no more durst he sayn,\nBut, \"Ere the thunder stint* there cometh rain.\"                 *ceases\nOf Phasiphae, that was queen of Crete,\nFor shrewedness* he thought the tale sweet.                  *wickedness\nFy, speak no more, it is a grisly thing,\nOf her horrible lust and her liking.\nOf Clytemnestra, for her lechery\nThat falsely made her husband for to die,\nHe read it with full good devotion.\nHe told me eke, for what occasion\nAmphiorax at Thebes lost his life:\nMy husband had a legend of his wife\nEryphile, that for an ouche* of gold                      *clasp, collar\nHad privily unto the Greekes told,\nWhere that her husband hid him in a place,\nFor which he had at Thebes sorry grace.\nOf Luna told he me, and of Lucie;\nThey bothe made their husbands for to die,\nThat one for love, that other was for hate.\nLuna her husband on an ev'ning late\nEmpoison'd had, for that she was his foe:\nLucia liquorish lov'd her husband so,\nThat, for he should always upon her think,\nShe gave him such a manner* love-drink,                         *sort of\nThat he was dead before it were the morrow:\nAnd thus algates* husbands hadde sorrow.                         *always\nThen told he me how one

Arius,                               *dear\n\"Give me a plant of thilke* blessed tree,                          *that\nAnd in my garden planted shall it be.\"\nOf later date of wives hath he read,\nThat some have slain their husbands in their bed,\nAnd let their *lechour dight them* all the night,      *lover ride them*\nWhile that the corpse lay on the floor upright:\nAnd some have driven nails into their brain,\nWhile that they slept, and thus they have them slain:\nSome have them given poison in their drink:\nHe spake more harm than hearte may bethink.\nAnd therewithal he knew of more proverbs,\nThan in this world there groweth grass or herbs.\n\"Better (quoth he) thine habitation\nBe with a lion, or a foul dragon,\nThan with a woman using for to chide.\nBetter (quoth he) high in the roof abide,\nThan with an angry woman in the house,\nThey be so wicked and contrarious:\nThey hate that their husbands loven aye.\"\nHe said, \"A woman cast her shame away\nWhen she cast

Among the evidences that Chaucer's great work was left\nincomplete, is the absence of any link of connexion between the\nWife of Bath's Prologue and Tale, and what goes before. This\ndeficiency has in some editions caused the Squire's and the\nMerchant's Tales to be interposed between those of the Man of\nLaw and the Wife of Bath; but in the Merchant's Tale there is\ninternal proof that it was told after the jolly Dame's.  Several\nmanuscripts contain verses designed to serve as a connexion;\nbut they are evidently not Chaucer's, and it is unnecessary to\ngive them here. Of this Prologue, which may fairly be regarded\nas a distinct autobiographical tale, Tyrwhitt says: \"The\nextraordinary length of it, as well as the vein of pleasantry that\nruns through it, is very suitable to the character of the speaker.\nThe greatest part must have been of Chaucer's own invention,\nthough one may plainly see that he had been reading the popular\ninvectives against marriage and women in general; such as the\n'Roman de la Rose,'  'Valerius ad Rufinum, De non Ducenda\nUxore,' ('Valerius to Rufinus, on not being ruled by one's wife')\nand particularly 'Hieronymus contra Jovinianum.' ('Jerome\nagainst Jovinianus')  St Jerome, among other things designed to\ndiscourage marriage, has inserted in his treatise a long passage\nfrom 'Liber Aureolus Theophrasti de Nuptiis.' ('Theophrastus's\nGolden Book of Marriage').\"\n\n2. A great part of the marriage service used to be performed in\nthe church-porch.\n\n3. Jesus and the Samaritan woman: John iv. 13.\n\n4. Dan: Lord; Latin, \"dominus.\"  Another reading is \"the wise\nman, King Solomon.\"\n\n5. Defended: forbade; French, \"defendre,\" to prohibit.\n\n6.

Jesus feeding the multitude with barley bread: Mark vi. 41,\n42.\n\n9. At Dunmow prevailed the custom of giving, amid much\nmerry making, a flitch of bacon to the married pair who had\nlived together for a year without quarrel or regret. The same\ncustom prevailed of old in Bretagne.\n\n10. \"Cagnard,\" or \"Caignard,\" a French term of reproach,\noriginally derived from \"canis,\" a dog.\n\n11. Parage: birth, kindred; from Latin, \"pario,\" I beget.\n\n12. Norice: nurse; French, \"nourrice.\"\n\n13. This and the previous quotation from Ptolemy are due to\nthe Dame's own fancy.\n\n14.

It is not clear whence Chaucer derived this tale. Tyrwhitt\nthinks it was taken from the story of Florent, in the first book of\nGower's \"Confessio Amantis;\" or perhaps from an older\nnarrative from which Gower himself borrowed. Chaucer has\ncondensed and otherwise improved the fable, especially by\nlaying the scene, not in Sicily, but at the court of our own King\nArthur.\n\n2. Limitours: begging friars. See note 18 to the prologue to the\nTales.\n\n3. Thorpes: villages.  Compare German, \"Dorf,\"; Dutch,\n\"Dorp.\"\n\n4.

Froissart says\nthat any one engaged in this sport \"alloit en riviere.\"\n\n7. Nice: foolish; French, \"niais.\"\n\n8. Claw us on the gall:  Scratch us on the sore place.

On the Tale of the Friar, and that of the Sompnour which\nfollows, Tyrwhitt has remarked that they \"are well engrafted\nupon that of the Wife of Bath. The ill-humour which shows\nitself between these two characters is quite natural, as no two\nprofessions at that time were at more constant variance.  The\nregular clergy, and particularly the mendicant friars, affected a\ntotal exemption from all ecclesiastical jurisdiction,  except that\nof the Pope, which made them exceedingly obnoxious to the\nbishops and of course to all the inferior officers of the national\nhierarchy.\" Both tales, whatever their origin, are bitter satires\non the greed and worldliness of the Romish clergy.\n\n\n\nTHE TALE.\n\n\nWhilom* there was dwelling in my country                 *once on a time\nAn archdeacon, a man of high degree,\nThat boldely did execution,\nIn punishing of fornication,\nOf witchecraft, and eke of bawdery,\nOf defamation, and adultery,\nOf churche-reeves,* and of testaments,                    *churchwardens\nOf contracts, and of lack of sacraments,\nAnd eke of many another manner* crime,                          *sort of\nWhich needeth not rehearsen at this time,\nOf usury, and simony also;\nBut, certes, lechours did he greatest woe;\nThey shoulde singen, if that they were hent;*                    *caught\nAnd smale tithers<1> were foul y-shent,*         *troubled, put to shame\nIf any person would on them complain;\nThere might astert them no pecunial pain.<2>\nFor smalle tithes, and small offering,\nHe made the people piteously to sing;\nFor ere the bishop caught them with his crook,\nThey weren in the archedeacon's book;\nThen had he, through his jurisdiction,\nPower to do on them correction.\n\nHe had a Sompnour ready to his hand,\nA slier boy was none in Engleland;\nFor subtlely he had his espiaille,*                           *espionage\nThat taught him well where it might aught avail.\nHe coulde spare of lechours one or two,\nTo teache him to four and twenty mo'.\nFor, -- though this Sompnour wood* be as a hare, --        *furious, mad\nTo tell his harlotry I will not spare,\nFor we be out of their correction,\nThey have of us no jurisdiction,\nNe never shall have, term of all their lives.\n\n\"Peter;

Possessioners: The regular religious orders, who had lands\nand fixed revenues; while the friars, by their vows, had to\ndepend on voluntary contributions, though their need suggested\nmany modes of evading the prescription.\n\n3. In Chaucer's day the most material notions about the tortures\nof hell prevailed, and were made the most of by the clergy, who\npreyed on the affection and fear of the survivors, through the\ningenious doctrine of purgatory. Old paintings and illuminations\nrepresent the dead as torn by hooks, roasted in fires, boiled in\npots, and subjected to many other physical torments.\n\n4. Qui cum patre: \"Who with the father\"; the closing words of\nthe final benediction pronounced at Mass.\n\n5. Askaunce: The word now means sideways or asquint; here it\nmeans \"as if;\" and its force is probably to suggest that the\nsecond friar, with an ostentatious stealthiness, noted down the\nnames of the liberal, to make them believe that they would be\nremembered in the holy beggars' orisons.\n\n6. A Godde's kichel/halfpenny: a little cake/halfpenny, given for\nGod's sake.\n\n7. Harlot: hired servant; from Anglo-Saxon, \"hyran,\" to hire;\nthe word was commonly applied to males.\n\n8.

The Rules of St Benedict granted peculiar honours and\nimmunities to monks who had lived fifty years -- the jubilee\nperiod -- in the order. The usual reading of the words ending\nthe two lines is \"loan\" or \"lone,\" and \"alone;\" but to walk alone\ndoes not seem to have been any peculiar privilege of a friar,\nwhile the idea of precedence, or higher place at table and in\nprocessions, is suggested by the reading in the text.\n\n13. Borel folk:  laymen, people who are not learned; \"borel\"\nwas a kind of coarse cloth.\n\n14. Eli: Elijah (1 Kings, xix.)\n\n15. An emperor Jovinian was famous in the mediaeval  legends\nfor his pride and luxury\n\n16. Cor meum eructavit: literally, \"My heart has belched forth;\"\nin our translation, (i.e. the Authorised \"King James\" Version -\nTranscriber) \"My heart is inditing a goodly matter.\"  (Ps. xlv.\n1.). \"Buf\" is meant to represent the sound  of an eructation, and\nto show the \"great reverence\" with which \"those in possession,\"\nthe monks of the rich monasteries, performed divine service,\n\n17. N'ere thou our brother, shouldest thou not thrive: if thou\nwert not of our  brotherhood, thou shouldst have no hope of\nrecovery.\n\n18.

Him that harrowed Hell: Christ. See note 14 to the Reeve's\nTale.\n\n23. Mr. Wright says that \"it was a common practice to grant\nunder the conventual seal to benefactors and others a brotherly\nparticipation in the spiritual good works of the convent, and in\ntheir expected reward after death.\"\n\n24. The friar had received a master's degree.\n\n25. The regular number of monks or friars in a convent was\nfixed at twelve,  with a superior, in imitation of the apostles and\ntheir Master; and large religious houses were held to consist of\nso many convents.\n\n\n\nTHE CLERK'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\n\"SIR Clerk of Oxenford,\" our Hoste said,\n\"Ye ride as still and coy, as doth a maid\nThat were new spoused, sitting at the board:\nThis day I heard not of your tongue a word.\nI trow ye study about some sophime:*                            *sophism\nBut Solomon saith, every thing hath time.\nFor Godde's sake, be of *better cheer,*                  *livelier mien*\nIt is no time for to study here.\nTell us some merry tale, by your fay;*                            *faith\nFor what man that is entered in a play,\nHe needes must unto that play assent.\nBut preache not, as friars do in Lent,\nTo make us for our olde sinnes weep,\nNor that thy tale make us not to sleep.\nTell us some merry thing of aventures.\nYour terms, your coloures, and your figures,\nKeep them in store, till so be ye indite\nHigh style, as when that men to kinges write.\nSpeake so plain at this time, I you pray,\nThat we may understande what ye say.\"\n\nThis worthy Clerk benignely answer'd;\n\"Hoste,\" quoth he, \"I am under your yerd,*                      *rod <1>\nYe have of us as now the governance,\nAnd therefore would I do you obeisance,\nAs far as reason asketh, hardily:*                        *boldly, truly\nI will you tell a tale, which that I\nLearn'd at Padova of a worthy clerk,\nAs proved by his wordes and his werk.\nHe is now dead, and nailed in his chest,\nI pray to God to give his soul good rest.\nFrancis Petrarc', the laureate poet,<2>\nHighte* this clerk, whose rhetoric so sweet                  *was called\nIllumin'd all Itale of poetry,\nAs Linian <3> did of philosophy,\nOr law, or other art particulere:\nBut death, that will not suffer us dwell here\nBut as it were a twinkling of an eye,\nThem both hath slain, and alle we shall die.\n\n\"But forth to tellen of this worthy man,\nThat taughte me this tale, as I began,\nI say that first he with high style inditeth\n(Ere he the body of his tale writeth)\nA proem, in the which describeth he\nPiedmont, and of Saluces <4> the country,\nAnd speaketh of the Pennine hilles high,\nThat be the bounds of all West Lombardy:\nAnd of Mount Vesulus in special,\nWhere as the Po out of a welle small\nTaketh his firste springing and his source,\nThat eastward aye increaseth in his course\nT'Emilia-ward, <5> to Ferraro, and Venice,\nThe which a long thing were to devise.*                         *narrate\nAnd truely, as to my judgement,\nMe thinketh it a thing impertinent,*                         *irrelevant\nSave that he would conveye his mattere:\nBut this is the tale, which that ye shall hear.\"\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Clerk's Tale\n\n\n1.

Petrarch, in his Latin romance, \"De obedientia et fide uxoria\nMythologia,\" (Of obedient and faithful wives in Mythology)\ntranslated the charming story of \"the patient Grizel\" from the\nItalian of Bocaccio's \"Decameron;\" and Chaucer has closely\nfollowed Petrarch's translation, made in 1373, the year before\nthat in which he died.  The fact that the embassy to Genoa, on\nwhich Chaucer was sent, took place in 1372-73, has lent\ncountenance to the opinion that the English poet did actually\nvisit the Italian bard at Padua, and hear the story from his own\nlips.  This, however, is only a probability; for it is a moot point\nwhether the two poets ever met.\n\n2. Vesulus:  Monte Viso, a lofty peak at the junction of the\nMaritime and Cottian Alps; from two springs on its east side\nrises the Po.\n\n3. Buxomly: obediently; Anglo-Saxon, \"bogsom,\" old English,\n\"boughsome,\" that can be easily bent or bowed; German,\n\"biegsam,\" pliant, obedient.\n\n4. Well ofter of the well than of the tun she drank: she drank\nwater much more often than wine.\n\n5. Undern: afternoon, evening, though by some \"undern\"\nis understood as dinner-time -- 9 a. m. See note 4 to the Wife of\nBath's Tale.\n\n6. Very: true; French \"vrai\".\n\n7. Nouches: Ornaments of some kind not precisely known;\nsome editions read \"ouches,\" studs, brooches. (Transcriber's\nnote: The OED gives \"nouches\" as a form of \"ouches,\"\nbuckles)\n\n8. A furlong way or two: a short time; literally, as long as it\ntakes to walk one or two furlongs (a furlong is 220 yards)\n\n9. Lordes' hestes may not be y-feign'd: it will not do merely to\nfeign compliance with a lord's commands.\n\n10. Arace: tear; French, \"arracher.\"\n\n11. Fele: many; German, \"viel.\"\n\n12. Dear enough a jane: worth nothing.  A jane was a small coin\nof little worth, so the meaning is \"not worth a red cent\".\n\n13. Mo: me.  \"This is one of the most licentious corruptions of\northography,\" says Tyrwhitt, \"that I remember to have observed\nin Chaucer;\" but such liberties were common among the\nEuropean poets of his time,  when there was an extreme lack of\ncertainty in orthography.\n\n14. The fourteen lines that follow are translated almost literally\nfrom Petrarch's Latin.\n\n15. For great skill is he proved that he wrought: for it is most\nreasonable that He should prove or test that which he made.\n\n16. Chichevache, in old popular fable, was a monster that fed\nonly on good women, and was always very thin from scarcity of\nsuch food; a corresponding monster, Bycorne, fed only on\nobedient and kind husbands, and was always fat. The origin of\nthe fable was French; but Lydgate has a ballad on the subject.\n\"Chichevache\" literally means \"niggardly\" or \"greedy cow.\"\n\n17. Countertail: Counter-tally or counter-foil; something exactly\ncorresponding.\n\n18. Aventail: forepart of a helmet, vizor.\n\n\n\nTHE MERCHANT'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.<l>\n\n\n\"Weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow,\nI have enough, on even and on morrow,\"\nQuoth the Merchant, \"and so have other mo',\nThat wedded be; I trow* that it be so;                          *believe\nFor well I wot it fareth so by me.\nI have a wife, the worste that may be,\nFor though the fiend to her y-coupled were,\nShe would him overmatch, I dare well swear.\nWhy should I you rehearse in special\nHer high malice? she is *a shrew at all.*                *thoroughly, in\nThere is a long and large difference                  everything wicked*\nBetwixt Griselda's greate patience,\nAnd of my wife the passing cruelty.\nWere I unbounden, all so may I the,*                             *thrive\nI woulde never eft* come in the snare.                            *again\nWe wedded men live in sorrow and care;\nAssay it whoso will, and he shall find\nThat I say sooth, by Saint Thomas of Ind,<2>\nAs for the more part; I say not all, --\nGod shielde* that it shoulde so befall.                          *forbid\nAh! good Sir Host, I have y-wedded be\nThese moneths two, and more not, pardie;\nAnd yet I trow* that he that all his life                       *believe\nWifeless hath been, though that men would him rive*               *wound\nInto the hearte, could in no mannere\nTelle so much sorrow, as I you here\nCould tellen of my wife's cursedness.\"*                      *wickedness\n\n\"Now,\" quoth our Host, \"Merchant, so God you bless,\nSince ye so muche knowen of that art,\nFull heartily I pray you tell us part.\"\n\"Gladly,\" quoth he; \"but of mine owen sore,\nFor sorry heart, I telle may no more.\"\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Merchant's Tale\n\n\n1.  Though the manner in which the Merchant takes up the\nclosing words of the Envoy to the Clerk's Tale, and refers to\nthe patience of Griselda, seems to prove beyond doubt that\nthe order of the Tales in the text is the right one, yet in\nsome manuscripts of good authority the Franklin's Tale\nfollows the Clerk's, and the Envoy is concluded by this\nstanza: --\n\"This worthy Clerk when ended was his tale,\nOur Hoste said, and swore by cocke's bones\n'Me lever were than a barrel of ale\nMy wife at home had heard this legend once;\nThis is a gentle tale for the nonce;\nAs, to my purpose, wiste ye my will.\nBut thing that will not be, let it be still.'\"\n\nIn other manuscripts of less authority the Host proceeds, in\ntwo similar stanzas, to impose a Tale on the Franklin; but\nTyrwhitt is probably right in setting them aside as spurious,\nand in admitting the genuineness of the first only, if it be\nsupposed that Chaucer forgot to cancel it when he had\ndecided on another mode of connecting the Merchant's with\nthe Clerk's Tale.\n\n2.

If, as is probable, this Tale was translated from the French,\nthe original is not now extant. Tyrwhitt remarks that the scene\n\"is laid in Italy, but none of the names, except Damian and\nJustin, seem to be Italian,  but rather made at pleasure; so that I\ndoubt whether the story be really of Italian growth. The\nadventure of the pear-tree I find in a small collection of Latin\nfables, written by one Adoiphus, in elegiac verses of his fashion,\nin the year 1315. . . . Whatever was the real origin of the Tale,\nthe machinery of the fairies, which Chaucer has used so happily,\nwas probably added by himself; and, indeed, I cannot help\nthinking that his Pluto and Proserpina were the true progenitors\nof Oberon and Titania; or rather, that they themselves have,\nonce at least, deigned to revisit our poetical system under the\nlatter names.\"\n\n2. Seculeres: of the laity; but perhaps, since the word is of two-\nfold meaning, Chaucer intends a hit at the secular clergy, who,\nunlike the regular orders, did not live separate from the world,\nbut shared in all its interests and pleasures -- all the more easily\nand freely, that they had not the civil restraint of marriage.\n\n3. This and the next eight lines are taken from the \"Liber\naureolus Theophrasti de nuptiis,\" (\"Theophrastus's Golden\nBook of Marriage\") quoted by Hieronymus, \"Contra\nJovinianum,\" (\"Against Jovinian\") and thence again by John of\nSalisbury.\n\n4. Mebles: movables, furniture, &c.; French, \"meubles.\"\n\n5. \"Wade's boat\" was called Guingelot; and in it, according to\nthe old romance, the owner underwent a long series of wild\nadventures, and performed many strange exploits.  The romance\nis lost, and therefore  the exact force of the phrase in the text is\nuncertain; but Mr Wright seems to be warranted in supposing\nthat Wade's adventures were cited as examples of craft and\ncunning -- that the hero, in fact, was a kind of Northern\nUlysses,  It is possible that to the same source we may trace the\nproverbial phrase, found in Chaucer's \"Remedy of Love,\" to\n\"bear Wattis pack\" signifying to be duped or beguiled.\n\n6. Stopen: advanced; past participle of \"step.\" Elsewhere\n\"y-stept in age\" is used by Chaucer.\n\n7. They did not need to go in quest of a wife for him, as they\nhad promised.\n\n8. Thilke tree: that tree of original sin, of which the special sins\nare the branches.\n\n9. Skinked:  poured out; from Anglo-Saxon, \"scencan.\"\n\n10. Marcianus Capella, who wrote a kind of philosophical\nromance, \"De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae\" (Of the Marriage\nof Mercury and Philology) . \"Her\" and \"him,\" two lines after,\nlike \"he\" applied to Theodomas, are prefixed to the proper\nnames for emphasis, according to the Anglo- Saxon usage.\n\n11. Familiar: domestic; belonging to the \"familia,\" or household.\n\n12. Hewe: domestic servant; from Anglo-Saxon, \"hiwa.\"\nTyrwhitt reads \"false of holy hue;\" but Mr Wright has properly\nrestored the reading adopted in the text.\n\n13. Boren man: born; owing to January faith and loyalty\nbecause born in his household.\n\n14. Hippocras: spiced wine. Clarre: also a kind of spiced wine.\nVernage: a wine believed to have come from Crete, although its\nname -- Italian,  \"Vernaccia\" -- seems to be derived from\nVerona.\n\n15. Dan Constantine: a medical author who wrote about 1080;\nhis works were printed at Basle in 1536.\n\n16. Full of jargon as a flecked pie: he chattered like a magpie\n\n17. Nearly all the manuscripts read \"in two of Taure;\" but\nTyrwhitt has shown that, setting out from the second degree of\nTaurus, the moon, which in the four complete days that Maius\nspent in her chamber could not have advanced more than fifty-\nthree degrees, would only have been at the twenty-fifth degree\nof Gemini -- whereas, by reading \"ten,\" she is brought to the\nthird degree of Cancer.\n\n18. Kid; or \"kidde,\" past participle of  \"kythe\" or \"kithe,\" to\nshow or discover.\n\n19. Precious:  precise, over-nice; French, \"precieux,\" affected.\n\n20. Proined: or \"pruned;\" carefully trimmed and dressed\nhimself. The word is used in falconry of a hawk when she picks\nand trims her feathers.\n\n21. A dogge for the bow: a dog attending a hunter with the\nbow.\n\n22  The Romance of the Rose: a very popular mediaeval\nromance, the English version of which is partly by Chaucer. It\nopens with a description of a beautiful garden.\n\n23. Priapus:  Son of Bacchus and Venus: he was regarded as\nthe promoter of fertility in all agricultural life, vegetable and\nanimal; while not only gardens, but fields, flocks, bees -- and\neven fisheries -- were supposed to be under his protection.\n\n24. Argus was employed by Juno to watch Io with his hundred\neyes but he was sent to sleep by the flute of Mercury, who then\ncut off his head.\n\n25. \"My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my\nfair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is past, the rain is\nover and gone: The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the\nsinging of the birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard\nin our land.\"\n-- Song of Solomon, ii. 10-12.\n\n26.                \"That fair field,\nOf Enna, where Proserpine, gath'ring flowers,\nHerself a fairer flow'r, by gloomy Dis\nWas gather'd.\"\n-- Milton, Paradise Lost, iv. 268\n\n27. \"Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one\nby one, to find out the account:\nWhich yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man amongst a\nthousand have I found, but a woman among all those I have not\nfound.\nLo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright.\"\nEcclesiastes vii. 27-29.\n\n28. Jesus, the son of Sirach, to whom is ascribed one of the\nbooks of the Apochrypha -- that called the \"Wisdom of Jesus\nthe Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus;\"  in which, especially in the\nninth and twenty-fifth chapters, severe cautions are given\nagainst women.\n\n29. Roman gestes: histories; such as those of Lucretia, Porcia,\n&c.\n\n30. May means January to believe that she is pregnant, and that\nshe has a craving for unripe pears.\n\n31. At this point, and again some twenty lines below, several\nverses of a very coarse character had been inserted in later\nmanuscripts; but they are evidently spurious, and are omitted in\nthe best editions.\n\n32. \"Store\" is the general reading here, but its meaning is not\nobvious.  \"Stowre\" is found in several manuscripts; it signifies\n\"struggle\" or \"resist;\" and both for its own appropriateness, and\nfor the force which it gives the word \"stronge,\" the reading in\nthe text seems the better.\n\n\n\nTHE SQUIRE'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\n\"HEY! Godde's mercy!\" said our Hoste tho,*                         *then\n\"Now such a wife I pray God keep me fro'.\nLo, suche sleightes and subtilities\nIn women be; for aye as busy as bees\nAre they us silly men for to deceive,\nAnd from the soothe* will they ever weive,**     *truth **swerve, depart\nAs this Merchante's tale it proveth well.\nBut natheless, as true as any steel,\nI have a wife, though that she poore be;\nBut of her tongue a labbing* shrew is she;                   *chattering\nAnd yet* she hath a heap of vices mo'.                         *moreover\nThereof *no force;* let all such thinges go.                 *no matter*\nBut wit* ye what? in counsel** be it said,    *know **secret, confidence\nMe rueth sore I am unto her tied;\nFor, an'* I shoulde reckon every vice                                *if\nWhich that she hath, y-wis* I were too nice;**      *certainly **foolish\nAnd cause why, it should reported be\nAnd told her by some of this company\n(By whom, it needeth not for to declare,\nSince women connen utter such chaffare <1>),\nAnd eke my wit sufficeth not thereto\nTo tellen all; wherefore my tale is do.*                           *done\nSquier, come near, if it your wille be,\nAnd say somewhat of love, for certes ye\n*Conne thereon* as much as any man.\"                     *know about it*\n\"Nay, Sir,\" quoth he; \"but such thing as I can,\nWith hearty will, -- for I will not rebel\nAgainst your lust,* -- a tale will I tell.                     *pleasure\nHave me excused if I speak amiss;\nMy will is good; and lo, my tale is this.\"\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Squire's Tale\n\n\n1. Women connen utter such chaffare: women are adepts at\ngiving circulation to such wares.  The Host evidently means that\nhis wife would be sure to hear of his confessions from some\nfemale member of the company.\n\n\nTHE TALE.<1>\n\n\n*Pars Prima.*                                               *First part*\n\nAt Sarra, in the land of Tartary,\nThere dwelt a king that warrayed* Russie, <2>               *made war on\nThrough which there died many a doughty man;\nThis noble king was called Cambuscan,<3>\nWhich in his time was of so great renown,\nThat there was nowhere in no regioun\nSo excellent a lord in alle thing:\nHim lacked nought that longeth to a king,\nAs of the sect of which that he was born.\nHe kept his law to which he was y-sworn,\nAnd thereto* he was hardy, wise, and rich,            *moreover, besides\nAnd piteous and just, always y-lich;*              *alike, even-tempered\nTrue of his word, benign and honourable;\n*Of his corage as any centre stable;*        *firm, immovable of spirit*\nYoung, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous\nAs any bachelor of all his house.\nA fair person he was, and fortunate,\nAnd kept alway so well his royal estate,\nThat there was nowhere such another man.\nThis noble king, this Tartar Cambuscan,\nHadde two sons by Elfeta his wife,\nOf which the eldest highte Algarsife,\nThe other was y-called Camballo.\nA daughter had this worthy king also,\nThat youngest was, and highte Canace:\nBut for to telle you all her beauty,\nIt lies not in my tongue, nor my conning;*                        *skill\nI dare not undertake so high a thing:\nMine English eke is insufficient,\nIt muste be a rhetor* excellent,                                 *orator\n*That couth his colours longing for that art,*                * see <4>*\nIf he should her describen any part;\nI am none such, I must speak as I can.\n\nAnd so befell, that when this Cambuscan\nHad twenty winters borne his diadem,\nAs he was wont from year to year, I deem,\nHe let *the feast of his nativity*                  *his birthday party*\n*Do crye,* throughout Sarra his city,                    *be proclaimed*\nThe last Idus of March, after the year.\nPhoebus the sun full jolly was and clear,\nFor he was nigh his exaltation\nIn Marte's face, and in his mansion <5>\nIn Aries, the choleric hot sign:\nFull lusty* was the weather and benign;                        *pleasant\nFor which the fowls against the sunne sheen,*                    *bright\nWhat for the season and the younge green,\nFull loude sange their affections:\nThem seemed to have got protections\nAgainst the sword of winter keen and cold.\nThis Cambuscan, of which I have you told,\nIn royal vesture, sat upon his dais,\nWith diadem, full high in his palace;\nAnd held his feast so solemn and so rich,\nThat in this worlde was there none it lich.*                       *like\nOf which if I should tell all the array,\nThen would it occupy a summer's day;\nAnd eke it needeth not for to devise*                          *describe\nAt every course the order of service.\nI will not tellen of their strange sewes,*                   *dishes <6>\nNor of their swannes, nor their heronsews.*            *young herons <7>\nEke in that land, as telle knightes old,\nThere is some meat that is full dainty hold,\nThat in this land men *reck of* it full small:                *care for*\nThere is no man that may reporten all.\nI will not tarry you, for it is prime,\nAnd for it is no fruit, but loss of time;\nUnto my purpose* I will have recourse.                        *story <8>\nAnd so befell that, after the third course,\nWhile that this king sat thus in his nobley,*               *noble array\nHearing his ministreles their thinges play\nBefore him at his board deliciously,\nIn at the halle door all suddenly\nThere came a knight upon a steed of brass,\nAnd in his hand a broad mirror of glass;\nUpon his thumb he had of gold a ring,\nAnd by his side a naked sword hanging:\nAnd up he rode unto the highe board.\nIn all the hall was there not spoke a word,\nFor marvel of this knight; him to behold\nFull busily they waited,* young and old.                        *watched\n\nThis strange knight, that came thus suddenly,\nAll armed, save his head, full richely,\nSaluted king, and queen, and lordes all,\nBy order as they satten in the hall,\nWith so high reverence and observance,\nAs well in speech as in his countenance,\nThat Gawain <9> with his olde courtesy,\nThough he were come again out of Faerie,\nHim *coulde not amende with a word.*               *could not better him\nAnd after this, before the highe board,                     by one word*\nHe with a manly voice said his message,\nAfter the form used in his language,\nWithoute vice* of syllable or letter.                             *fault\nAnd, for his tale shoulde seem the better,\nAccordant to his worde's was his cheer,*                      *demeanour\nAs teacheth art of speech them that it lear.*                     *learn\nAlbeit that I cannot sound his style,\nNor cannot climb over so high a stile,\nYet say I this, as to *commune intent,*       *general sense or meaning*\n*Thus much amounteth* all that ever he meant,       *this is the sum of*\nIf it so be that I have it in mind.\nHe said; \"The king of Araby and Ind,\nMy liege lord, on this solemne day\nSaluteth you as he best can and may,\nAnd sendeth you, in honour of your feast,\nBy me, that am all ready at your hest,*                         *command\nThis steed of brass, that easily and well\nCan in the space of one day naturel\n(This is to say, in four-and-twenty hours),\nWhereso you list, in drought or else in show'rs,\nBeare your body into every place\nTo which your hearte willeth for to pace,*                     *pass, go\nWithoute wem* of you, through foul or fair.                *hurt, injury\nOr if you list to fly as high in air\nAs doth an eagle, when him list to soar,\nThis same steed shall bear you evermore\nWithoute harm, till ye be where *you lest*              *it pleases you*\n(Though that ye sleepen on his back, or rest),\nAnd turn again, with writhing* of a pin.                       *twisting\nHe that it wrought, he coude* many a gin;**     *knew **contrivance <10>\nHe waited* in any a constellation,                             *observed\nEre he had done this operation,\nAnd knew full many a seal <11> and many a bond\nThis mirror eke, that I have in mine hond,\nHath such a might, that men may in it see\nWhen there shall fall any adversity\nUnto your realm, or to yourself also,\nAnd openly who is your friend or foe.\nAnd over all this, if any lady bright\nHath set her heart on any manner wight,\nIf he be false, she shall his treason see,\nHis newe love, and all his subtlety,\nSo openly that there shall nothing hide.\nWherefore, against this lusty summer-tide,\nThis mirror, and this ring that ye may see,\nHe hath sent to my lady Canace,\nYour excellente daughter that is here.\nThe virtue of this ring, if ye will hear,\nIs this, that if her list it for to wear\nUpon her thumb, or in her purse it bear,\nThere is no fowl that flyeth under heaven,\nThat she shall not well understand his steven,*           *speech, sound\nAnd know his meaning openly and plain,\nAnd answer him in his language again:\nAnd every grass that groweth upon root\nShe shall eke know, to whom it will do boot,*                    *remedy\nAll be his woundes ne'er so deep and wide.\nThis naked sword, that hangeth by my side,\nSuch virtue hath, that what man that it smite,\nThroughout his armour it will carve and bite,\nWere it as thick as is a branched oak:\nAnd what man is y-wounded with the stroke\nShall ne'er be whole, till that you list, of grace,\nTo stroke him with the flat in thilke* place                   *the same\nWhere he is hurt; this is as much to sayn,\nYe muste with the flatte sword again\nStroke him upon the wound, and it will close.\nThis is the very sooth, withoute glose;*                         *deceit\nIt faileth not, while it is in your hold.\"\n\nAnd when this knight had thus his tale told,\nHe rode out of the hall, and down he light.\nHis steede, which that shone as sunne bright,\nStood in the court as still as any stone.\nThe knight is to his chamber led anon,\nAnd is unarmed, and to meat y-set.*                              *seated\nThese presents be full richely y-fet,* --                       *fetched\nThis is to say, the sword and the mirrour, --\nAnd borne anon into the highe tow'r,\nWith certain officers ordain'd therefor;\nAnd unto Canace the ring is bore\nSolemnely, where she sat at the table;\nBut sickerly, withouten any fable,\nThe horse of brass, that may not be remued.*               *removed <12>\nIt stood as it were to the ground y-glued;\nThere may no man out of the place it drive\nFor no engine of windlass or polive; *                           *pulley\nAnd cause why, for they *can not the craft;*       *know not the cunning\nAnd therefore in the place they have it laft,          of the mechanism*\nTill that the knight hath taught them the mannere\nTo voide* him, as ye shall after hear.                           *remove\n\nGreat was the press, that swarmed to

and her mirrour,.\nThat twenty times she changed her colour;\nAnd in her sleep, right for th' impression\nOf her mirror, she had a vision.\nWherefore, ere that the sunne gan up glide,\nShe call'd upon her mistress'* her beside,                  *governesses\nAnd saide, that her liste for to rise.\n\nThese olde women, that be gladly wise\nAs are her mistresses answer'd anon,\nAnd said; \"Madame, whither will ye gon\nThus early? for the folk be all in rest.\"\n\"I will,\" quoth she, \"arise; for me lest\nNo longer for to sleep, and walk about.\"\nHer mistresses call'd women a great rout,\nAnd up they rose, well a ten or twelve;\nUp rose freshe Canace herselve,\nAs ruddy and bright as is the yonnge sun\nThat in the Ram is four degrees y-run;\nNo higher was he, when she ready was;\nAnd forth she walked easily a pace,\nArray'd after the lusty* season swoot,**               *pleasant **sweet\nLightely for to play, and walk on foot,\nNought but with five or six of her meinie;\nAnd in a

that same reason thinketh me.\nI shoulde unto the knotte condescend,\nAnd maken of her walking soon an end.\n\nAmid a tree fordry*, as white as chalk,             *thoroughly dried up\nThere sat a falcon o'er her head full high,\nThat with a piteous voice so gan to cry;\nThat all the wood resounded of her cry,\nAnd beat she had herself so piteously\nWith both her winges, till the redde blood\nRan endelong* the tree, there as she stood           *from top to bottom\nAnd ever-in-one* alway she cried and shright;**  *incessantly **shrieked\nAnd with her beak herselfe she so pight,*                       *wounded\nThat there is no tiger, nor cruel beast,\nThat dwelleth either in wood or in forest;\nBut would have wept, if that he weepe could,\nFor sorrow of her; she shriek'd alway so loud.\nFor there was never yet no man alive,\nIf that he could a falcon well descrive;*                      *describe\nThat heard of such another of fairness\nAs well of plumage, as of gentleness;\nOf shape, of all that mighte reckon'd be.\nA falcon peregrine seemed she,\nOf fremde* land; and ever as she stood                     *foreign <28>\nShe swooned now and now for lack of blood;\nTill well-nigh is she fallen from the tree.\n\nThis faire kinge's daughter Canace,\nThat on her finger bare the quainte ring,\nThrough which she understood well every  thing\nThat any fowl may in his leden* sayn,                    **language <29>\nAnd could him answer in his leden again;\nHath understoode what this falcon said,\nAnd well-nigh for the ruth* almost she died;.                      *pity\nAnd to the tree she went, full hastily,\nAnd on this falcon looked piteously;\nAnd held her lap abroad; for well she wist\nThe falcon muste falle from the twist*                      *twig, bough\nWhen that she swooned next, for lack of blood.\nA longe while to waite her she stood;\nTill at the last she apake in this mannere\nUnto the hawk, as ye shall after hear:\n\"What is the cause, if it be for to tell,\nThat ye be in this furial* pain of hell?\"               *raging, furious\nQuoth Canace unto this hawk above;\n\"Is this for sorrow of of death; or loss of love?\nFor; as I trow,* these be the causes two;                       *believe\nThat cause most a gentle hearte woe:\nOf other harm it needeth not to speak.\nFor ye yourself upon yourself awreak;*

yourselfe grace;*                 *have mercy on\nOr what may be your help? for, west nor east,                  yourself*\nI never saw ere now no bird nor beast\nThat fared with himself so piteously\nYe slay me with your sorrow verily;\nI have of you so great compassioun.\nFor Godde's love come from the tree adown\nAnd, as I am a kinge's daughter true,\nIf that I verily the causes knew\nOf your disease,* if it lay in my might,                       *distress\nI would amend it, ere that it were night,\nSo wisly help me the great God of kind.**               *surely **nature\nAnd herbes shall I right enoughe find,\nTo heale with your hurtes hastily.\"\nThen shriek'd this falcon yet more piteously\nThan ever she did, and fell to ground anon,\nAnd lay aswoon, as dead as lies a stone,\nTill Canace had in her lap her take,\nUnto that time she gan of swoon awake:\nAnd, after that she out of swoon abraid,*                         *awoke\nRight in her hawke's leden thus she said:\n\n\"That pity runneth soon in gentle heart\n(Feeling his simil'tude in paines smart),\nIs proved every day, as men may see,\nAs well *by work as by authority;*        *by experience as by

        *depart\nAnd ever while the one her sorrow told,\nThe other wept, *as she to water wo'ld,*       *as if she would dissolve\nTill that the falcon bade her to be still,                   into

sorrow,\nAnd took him by the hand, Saint John to borrow,*        *witness, pledge\nAnd said him thus; 'Lo, I am youres all;\nBe such as I have been to you, and shall.'\nWhat he answer'd, it needs not

              *again **lap\nGreat was the sorrow, for that hawke's harm,\nThat Canace and all her women made;\nThey wist not how they might the falcon glade.*                 *gladden\nBut Canace home

precious and fine of hue,\nTo heale with this hawk; from day to night\nShe did her business, and all her might.\nAnd by her bedde's head she made a mew,*                      *bird cage\nAnd cover'd

The Squire's Tale has not been found under any other form\namong the literary remains of the Middle Ages; and it is\nunknown from what original it was derived, if from any. The\nTale is unfinished, not because the conclusion has been lost, but\nbecause the author left it so.\n\n2. The Russians and Tartars waged constant hostilities between\nthe thirteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\n3. In the best manuscripts the name is \"Cambynskan,\" and thus,\nno doubt, it should strictly be read. But it is a most pardonable\noffence against literal accuracy to use the word which Milton\nhas made classical, in \"Il Penseroso,\" speaking of\n\n           \"him that left half-told\nThe story of Cambuscan bold,\nOf Camball, and of Algarsife,\nAnd who had Canace to wife,\nThat owned the virtuous Ring and Glass,\nAnd of the wondrous Horse of Brass,\nOn which the Tartar King did ride\"\n\nSurely the admiration of Milton might well seem to the spirit of\nChaucer to condone a much greater transgression on his domain\nthan this verbal change -- which to both eye and ear is an\nunquestionable improvement on the uncouth original.\n\n4. Couth his colours longing for that art: well skilled in using\nthe colours -- the word-painting -- belonging to his art.\n\n5. Aries was the mansion of Mars -- to whom \"his\" applies.\nLeo was the mansion of the Sun.\n\n6. Sewes:  Dishes, or soups. The precise force of the word is\nuncertain; but it may be connected with \"seethe,\" to boil, and it\nseems to describe a dish in which the flesh was served up amid a\nkind of broth or gravy. The \"sewer,\" taster or assayer of the\nviands served at great tables, probably derived his name from\nthe verb to \"say\" or \"assay;\" though Tyrwhitt would connect\nthe two words, by taking both from the French, \"asseoir,\" to\nplace -- making the arrangement of the table the leading duty of\nthe \"sewer,\" rather than the testing of the food.\n\n7. Heronsews: young herons; French, \"heronneaux.\"\n\n8. Purpose: story, discourse; French, \"propos.\"\n\n9. Gawain was celebrated in mediaeval romance as the most\ncourteous among King Arthur's knights.\n\n10. Gin: contrivance; trick; snare. Compare Italian, \"inganno,\"\ndeception; and our own \"engine.\"\n\n11. Mr Wright remarks that \"the making and arrangement of\nseals was one of the important operations of mediaeval magic.\"\n\n12. Remued: removed; French, \"remuer,\" to stir.\n\n13. Polies:  Apulian. The horses of Apulia -- in old French\n\"Poille,\" in Italian \"Puglia\" -- were held in high value.\n\n14. The Greeke's horse Sinon: the wooden horse of the Greek\nSinon, introduced  into Troy by the stratagem of its maker.\n\n15. Master tower: chief tower; as, in the Knight's Tale, the\nprincipal street is called the \"master street.\"  See note 86 to the\nKnight's Tale.\n\n16. Alhazen and Vitellon: two writers on optics -- the first\nsupposed to have lived about 1100, the other about 1270.\nTyrwhitt says that their works were printed at Basle in 1572,\nunder the title \"Alhazeni et Vitellonis Opticae.\"\n\n17. Telephus, a son of Hercules, reigned over Mysia when the\nGreeks came to besiege Troy, and he sought to prevent their\nlanding.  But, by the art of Dionysus, he was made to stumble\nover a vine, and Achilles wounded him with his spear.  The\noracle informed Telephus that the hurt could be healed only by\nhim, or by the weapon, that inflicted it; and the king, seeking\nthe Grecian camp, was healed by Achilles with the rust of the\ncharmed spear.\n\n18. Ferne: before; a corruption of \"forne,\" from Anglo-Saxon,\n\"foran.\"\n\n19. Aldrian: or Aldebaran; a star in the neck of the constellation\nLeo.\n\n20. Chamber of parements:  Presence-chamber, or chamber of\nstate, full of  splendid furniture and ornaments. The same\nexpression is used in French and Italian.\n\n21. In Pisces, Venus was said to be at her exaltation or greatest\npower. A planet, according to the old astrologers, was in\n\"exaltation\" when in the sign of the Zodiac in which it exerted\nits strongest influence; the opposite sign, in which it was\nweakest, was called its \"dejection.\"\n\n22. Launcelot:  Arthur's famous knight, so accomplished and\ncourtly, that he was held the very pink of chivalry.\n\n23. Trill: turn;  akin to \"thirl\", \"drill.\"\n\n24. Ride: another reading is \"bide,\" alight or remain.\n\n25. Feastying: entertaining; French, \"festoyer,\"  to feast.\n\n26. The old physicians held that blood dominated in  the human\nbody late at night and in the early morning.  Galen says that the\ndomination lasts for seven hours.\n\n27. Fumosity: fumes of wine rising from the stomach to the\nhead.\n\n28. Fremde: foreign, strange; German, \"fremd\" in the northern\ndialects, \"frem,\" or \"fremmed,\" is used in the same sense.\n\n29. Leden: Language, dialect; from Anglo-Saxon, \"leden\" or\n\"laeden,\" a corruption from \"Latin.\"\n\n30. Tercelet: the \"tassel,\" or male of any species of hawk; so\ncalled, according to Cotgrave, because he is one third (\"tiers\")\nsmaller than the female.\n\n31. \"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the\none Adah, and the name of the other Zillah\" (Gen. iv. 19).\n\n32. Galoche:  shoe; it seems to have been used in France, of a\n\"sabot,\" or wooden shoe.  The reader cannot fail to recall the\nsame illustration in John i. 27, where the Baptist says of Christ:\n\"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me; whose\nshoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.\"\n\n33. Byleve; stay; another form is \"bleve;\" from Anglo-Saxon,\n\"belitan,\" to remain.  Compare German, \"bleiben.\"\n\n34. This sentiment, as well as the illustration of the bird which\nfollows, is taken from the third book of Boethius, \"De\nConsolatione Philosophiae,\" metrum 2. It has thus been\nrendered in Chaucer's translation: \"All things seek aye to their\nproper course, and all things rejoice on their returning again to\ntheir nature.\"\n\n35. Men love of proper kind newfangleness: Men, by their own\n-- their very -- nature, are fond of novelty, and prone to\ninconstancy.\n\n36. Blue was the colour of truth, as green was that of\ninconstancy.  In John Stowe's additions to Chaucer's works,\nprinted in 1561, there is \"A balade whiche Chaucer made\nagainst women inconstaunt,\" of which the refrain is, \"In stead of\nblue, thus may ye wear all green.\"\n\n37. Unless we suppose this to be a namesake of the Camballo\nwho was Canace's brother -- which is not at all probable -- we\nmust agree with Tyrwhitt that there is a mistake here; which no\ndoubt Chaucer would have rectified, if the tale had not been\n\"left half-told,\" One manuscript reads \"Caballo;\" and though not\nmuch authority need be given to a difference that may be due to\nmere omission of the mark of contraction over the \"a,\" there is\nenough in the text to show that another person than the king's\nyounger son is intended.  The Squire promises to tell the\nadventures that befell each member of Cambuscan's family; and\nin thorough consistency with this plan, and with the canons of\nchivalric story, would be \"the marriage of Canace to some\nknight who was first obliged to fight for her with her two\nbrethren; a method of courtship,\" adds Tyrwhitt, \"very\nconsonant to the spirit of ancient chivalry.\"\n\n38. (Trancriber's note) In some manuscripts the following two\nlines, being the beginning of the third part, are found: -\n\nApollo whirleth up his chair so high,\nTill that Mercurius' house, the sly...\n\n\n\nTHE FRANKLIN'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE. <1>\n\n\n\"IN faith, Squier, thou hast thee well acquit,\nAnd gentilly; I praise well thy wit,\"\nQuoth the Franklin; \"considering thy youthe\nSo feelingly thou speak'st, Sir, I aloue* thee,          *allow, approve\n*As to my doom,* there is none that is here       *so far as my judgment\nOf eloquence that shall be thy peer,                               goes*\nIf that thou live; God give thee goode chance,\nAnd in virtue send thee continuance,\nFor of thy speaking I have great dainty.*                 *value, esteem\nI have a son, and, by the Trinity;\n*It were me lever* than twenty pound worth land,        *I would rather*\nThough it right now were fallen in my hand,\nHe were a man of such discretion\nAs that ye be: fy on possession,\n*But if* a man be virtuous withal.                               *unless\nI have my sone snibbed* and yet shall,              *rebuked; \"snubbed.\"\nFor he to virtue *listeth not t'intend,*               *does not wish to\nBut for to play at dice, and to dispend,                  apply himself*\nAnd lose all that he hath, is his usage;\nAnd he had lever talke with a page,\nThan to commune with any gentle wight,\nThere he might learen gentilless aright.\"\n\nStraw for your gentillesse!\" quoth our Host.\n\"What?

In the older editions, the verses here given as the prologue\nwere prefixed to the Merchant's Tale, and put into his mouth.\nTyrwhitt was abundantly justified, by the internal evidence\nafforded by the lines themselves, in transferring them to their\npresent place.\n\n2. The \"Breton Lays\" were an important and curious element in\nthe literature of the Middle Ages; they were originally\ncomposed in the Armorican language, and the chief collection\nof them extant was translated into French verse by a poetess\ncalling herself \"Marie,\" about the middle of the thirteenth\ncentury.  But though this collection was the most famous, and\nhad doubtless been read by Chaucer, there were other British or\nBreton lays, and from one of those the Franklin's Tale is taken.\nBoccaccio has dealt with the same story in the \"Decameron\"\nand the \"Philocopo,\"  altering the circumstances to suit the\nremoval of its scene to a southern clime.\n\n\nTHE TALE.\n\n\nIn Armoric', that called is Bretagne,\nThere was a knight, that lov'd and *did his pain*      *devoted himself,\nTo serve a lady in his beste wise;                               strove*\nAnd many a labour, many a great emprise,*                    *enterprise\nHe for his lady wrought, ere she were won:\nFor she was one the fairest under sun,\nAnd eke thereto come of so high kindred,\nThat *well unnethes durst this knight for dread,*         *see note <1>*\nTell her his woe, his pain, and his distress\nBut, at the last, she for his worthiness,\nAnd namely* for his meek obeisance,                          *especially\nHath such a pity caught of his penance,*            *suffering, distress\nThat privily she fell of his accord\nTo take him for her husband and her lord\n(Of such lordship as men have o'er their wives);\nAnd, for to lead the more in bliss their lives,\nOf his free will he swore her as a knight,\nThat never in all his life he day nor night\nShould take upon himself no mastery\nAgainst her will, nor kithe* her jealousy,                         *show\nBut her obey, and follow her will in all,\nAs any lover to his lady shall;\nSave that the name of sovereignety\nThat would he have, for shame of his degree.\nShe thanked him, and with full great humbless\nShe saide; \"Sir, since of your gentleness\nYe proffer me to have so large a reign,\n*Ne woulde God never betwixt us twain,\nAs in my guilt, were either war or strife:*               *see note <2>*\nSir, I will be your humble true wife,\nHave here my troth, till that my hearte brest.\"*                  *burst\nThus be they both in quiet and in rest.\n\nFor one thing, Sires, safely dare I say,\nThat friends ever each other must obey,\nIf they will longe hold in company.\nLove will not be constrain'd by mastery.\nWhen mast'ry comes, the god of love anon\nBeateth <3> his wings, and, farewell, he is gone.\nLove is a thing as any spirit free.\nWomen *of kind* desire liberty,                              *by nature*\nAnd not to be constrained as a thrall,*                           *slave\nAnd so do men, if soothly I say shall.\nLook who that is most patient in love,\nHe *is at his advantage all above.*

is,\nThat he not doth or saith sometimes amiss.\nIre, or sickness, or constellation,*                   *the influence of\nWine, woe, or changing of complexion,                       the planets*\nCauseth full oft to do amiss or speaken:\nOn every wrong a man may not be wreaken.*                      *revenged\nAfter* the time must be temperance                         *according

she to him full wisly* gan to swear                          *surely\nThat never should there be default in her.\nHere may men see a humble wife accord;\nThus hath she ta'en her servant and her lord,\nServant in love, and lord in marriage.\nThen was he both in lordship and servage?\nServage? nay, but in lordship all above,\nSince he had both his lady and his love:\nHis lady certes, and his wife also,\nThe which that law of love accordeth to.\nAnd when he was in this prosperrity,\nHome with his wife he went to his country,\nNot far from Penmark,<4> where his dwelling was,\nAnd there he liv'd in bliss and in solace.*                     *delight\nWho coulde tell, but* he had wedded be,                          *unless\nThe joy, the ease, and the prosperity,\nThat is betwixt a husband and his wife?\nA year and more lasted this blissful life,\nTill that this knight, of whom I spake thus,\nThat of Cairrud <5> was call'd Arviragus,\nShope* him to go and dwell a year or twain           *prepared, arranged\nIn Engleland, that call'd was eke Britain,\nTo seek in armes worship and honour\n(For all his lust* he set in such labour);                     *pleasure\nAnd dwelled there two years; the book saith thus.\n\nNow will I stint* of this Arviragus,                     *cease speaking\nAnd speak I will of Dorigen his wife,\nThat lov'd her husband as her hearte's life.\nFor his absence weepeth she and siketh,*                        *sigheth\nAs do these noble wives when them liketh;\nShe mourneth, waketh, waileth, fasteth, plaineth;\nDesire of his presence her so distraineth,\nThat all this wide world she set at nought.\nHer friendes, which that knew her heavy thought,\nComforte her in all that ever they may;\nThey preache her, they tell her night and day,\nThat causeless she slays herself, alas!\nAnd every comfort possible in this case\nThey do to her, with all their business,*                     *assiduity\nAnd all to make her leave her heaviness.\nBy process, as ye knowen every one,\nMen may so longe graven in a stone,\nTill some figure therein imprinted be:\nSo long have they comforted her, till she\nReceived hath, by hope and by reason,\nTh' imprinting of their consolation,\nThrough which her greate sorrow gan assuage;\nShe may not always duren in such rage.\nAnd eke Arviragus, in all this care,\nHath sent his letters home of his welfare,\nAnd that he will come hastily again,\nOr elles had this sorrow her hearty-slain.\nHer friendes saw her sorrow gin to slake,*            *slacken, diminish\nAnd prayed her on knees for Godde's sake\nTo come and roamen in their company,\nAway to drive her darke fantasy;\nAnd finally she granted that request,\nFor well she saw that it was for the best.\n\nNow stood her castle faste by the sea,\nAnd often with her friendes walked she,\nHer to disport upon the bank on high,\nThere as many a ship and barge sigh,*                               *saw\nSailing their courses, where them list to go.\nBut then was that a parcel* of her woe,                            *part\nFor to herself full oft, \"Alas!\" said she,\nIs there no ship, of so many as I see,\nWill bringe home my lord? then were my heart\nAll warish'd* of this bitter paine's smart.\"                  *cured <6>\nAnother time would she sit and think,\nAnd cast her eyen downward from the brink;\nBut when she saw the grisly rockes blake,*                        *black\nFor very fear so would her hearte quake,\nThat on her feet she might her not sustene*                     *sustain\nThen would she sit adown upon the green,\nAnd piteously *into the sea behold,*               *look out on the sea*\nAnd say right thus, with *careful sikes* cold:           *painful sighs*\n\"Eternal God! that through thy purveyance\nLeadest this world by certain governance,\n*In idle,* as men say, ye nothing make;                  *idly, in vain*\nBut, Lord, these grisly fiendly rockes blake,\nThat seem rather a foul confusion\nOf work, than any fair creation\nOf such a perfect wise God and stable,\nWhy have ye wrought this work unreasonable?\nFor by this work, north, south, or west, or east,\nThere is not foster'd man, nor bird, nor beast:\nIt doth no good, to my wit, but *annoyeth.*         *works mischief* <7>\nSee ye not, Lord, how mankind it destroyeth?\nA hundred thousand bodies of mankind\nHave rockes slain, *all be they not in mind;*           *though they are\nWhich mankind is so fair part of thy work,                    forgotten*\nThou madest it like to thine owen mark.*

ever annoy.\nI wot well, clerkes will say as them lest,*                      *please\nBy arguments, that all is for the best,\nAlthough I can the causes not y-know;\nBut thilke* God that made the wind to blow,                        *that\nAs keep my lord, this is my conclusion:\nTo clerks leave I all disputation:\nBut would to God that all these rockes blake\nWere sunken into helle for his sake\nThese rockes slay mine hearte for the fear.\"\nThus would she say, with many a piteous tear.\n\nHer friendes saw that it was no disport\nTo roame by the sea, but discomfort,\nAnd shope* them for to playe somewhere else.                   *arranged\nThey leade her by rivers and by wells,\nAnd eke in other places delectables;\nThey dancen, and they play at chess and tables.*             *backgammon\nSo on a day, right in the morning-tide,\nUnto a garden that was there beside,\nIn which that they had made their ordinance*     *provision, arrangement\nOf victual, and of other purveyance,\nThey go and play them all the longe day:\nAnd this was on the sixth morrow of May,\nWhich May had painted with his softe showers\nThis garden full of leaves and of flowers:\nAnd craft of manne's hand so curiously\nArrayed had this garden truely,\nThat never was there garden of such price,*               *value, praise\n*But if* it were the very Paradise.

distress;\nSo full it was of beauty and pleasance.\nAnd after dinner they began to dance\nAnd sing also, save Dorigen alone\nWho made alway her complaint and her moan,\nFor she saw not him on the dance go\nThat was her husband, and her love also;\nBut natheless she must a time abide\nAnd with good hope let her sorrow slide.\n\nUpon this dance, amonge other men,\nDanced a squier before Dorigen\nThat fresher was, and jollier of array\n*As to my doom,* than is the month of May.              *in my judgment*\nHe sang and danced, passing any man,\nThat is or was since that the world began;\nTherewith he was, if men should him descrive,\nOne of the *beste faring* men alive,                 *most accomplished*\nYoung, strong, and virtuous, and rich, and wise,\nAnd well beloved, and holden in great price.*             *esteem, value\nAnd, shortly if the sooth I telle shall,\n*Unweeting of* this Dorigen at all,                         *unknown to*\nThis lusty squier, servant to

complaining;\nHe said, he lov'd, and was belov'd nothing.\nOf suche matter made he many lays,\nSonges, complaintes, roundels, virelays <8>\nHow that he durste not his sorrow tell,\nBut languished, as doth a Fury in hell;\nAnd die he must, he said, as did Echo\nFor Narcissus, that durst not tell her woe.\nIn other manner than ye hear me say,\nHe durste not to her his woe bewray,\nSave that

whole withoute for to seen,\nBut in his heart aye was the arrow keen,\nAnd well ye know that of a sursanure <11>\nIn surgery is perilous the cure,\nBut* men might touch the arrow or come thereby.                  *except\nHis brother wept and wailed privily,\nTill at the last him fell in remembrance,\nThat while he was at Orleans <12> in France, --\nAs younge clerkes, that be likerous* --                           *eager\nTo readen artes that be curious,\nSeeken in every *halk and every hern*             *nook and corner* <13>\nParticular sciences for to learn,--\nHe him remember'd, that upon a day\nAt Orleans in study a book he say*                                  *saw\nOf magic natural, which his fellaw,\nThat was that time a bachelor of law\nAll* were he there to learn another craft,                       *though\nHad privily upon his desk y-laft;\nWhich book spake much of operations\nTouching the eight and-twenty mansions\nThat longe to the Moon, and such folly\nAs in our dayes is not worth a fly;\nFor holy church's faith, in our believe,*                 *belief, creed\nUs suff'reth none illusion to grieve.\nAnd when this book was in his remembrance\nAnon for joy his heart began to dance,\nAnd to himself he saide privily;\n\"My brother shall be warish'd* hastily                            *cured\nFor I am sicker* that there be sciences,                        *certain\nBy which men make divers apparences,\nSuch as these subtle tregetoures play.                  *tricksters <14>\nFor oft at feaste's have I well heard say,\nThat tregetours, within a halle

*victuals, food\nSo well-array'd a house as there was one,\nAurelius in his life saw never none.\nHe shewed him, ere they went to suppere,\nForestes, parkes, full of wilde deer.\nThere saw he hartes with their hornes high,\nThe greatest that were ever seen with eye.\nHe saw of them an hundred slain with hounds,\nAnd some with arrows bleed of bitter wounds.\nHe saw, when voided* were the wilde deer,                   *passed away\nThese falconers upon a fair rivere,\nThat with their hawkes have the heron slain.\nThen saw he knightes jousting in a plain.\nAnd after this he did him such pleasance,\nThat he him shew'd his lady on a dance,\nIn which himselfe danced, as him thought.\nAnd when this master, that this magic wrought,\nSaw it was time, he clapp'd his handes two,\nAnd farewell, all the revel is y-go.*                     *gone, removed\nAnd yet remov'd they never out of the house,\nWhile they saw all the sightes marvellous;\nBut in his study, where his bookes be,\nThey satte still, and no wight but they three.\nTo him this master called his squier,\n\nAnd said him thus, \"May we go to supper?\nAlmost an hour it is, I undertake,\nSince I you bade our supper for to make,\nWhen that these worthy men wente with me\nInto my study, where my bookes be.\"\n\"Sir,\" quoth this squier, \"when it liketh you.\nIt is all ready, though ye will right now.\"\n\"Go we then sup,\" quoth he, \"as for the best;\nThese amorous folk some time must have rest.\"\nAt after supper fell they in treaty\nWhat summe should this master's guerdon* be,                     *reward\nTo remove all the rockes of Bretagne,\nAnd eke from Gironde <16> to the mouth of Seine.\nHe made it strange,* and swore, so God him save,            *a matter of\nLess than a thousand pound

reverence,\nAnd prayed him to do his diligence\nTo bringe him out of his paines smart,\nOr with a sword that he would slit his heart.\nThis subtle clerk such ruth* had on this man,                      *pity\nThat night and day he sped him, that he can,\nTo wait a time of his conclusion;\nThis is to say, to make illusion,\nBy such an appearance of jugglery\n(I know no termes of astrology),\nThat she and every wight should ween and say,\nThat of Bretagne the rockes were away,\nOr else they were sunken under ground.\nSo at the last he hath a time found\nTo make his japes* and his wretchedness

nought,\nNeither his collect, nor his expanse years,\nNeither his rootes, nor his other gears,\nAs be his centres, and his arguments,\nAnd his proportional convenients\nFor his equations in everything.\nAnd by his eighte spheres in his working,\nHe knew full well how far Alnath <20> was shove\nFrom the head of that fix'd Aries above,\nThat in the ninthe sphere consider'd is.\nFull subtilly he calcul'd all this.\nWhen he had found his firste mansion,\nHe knew the remnant by proportion;\nAnd knew the rising of his moone well,\nAnd in whose face, and term, and every deal;\nAnd knew full well the moone's mansion\nAccordant to his operation;\nAnd knew also his other observances,\nFor such illusions and such meschances,*                 *wicked devices\nAs heathen folk used in

witness. <22>\nWhen thirty tyrants full of cursedness*                      *wickedness\nHad slain Phidon in Athens at the feast,\nThey commanded his daughters to arrest,\nAnd bringe them before them, in despite,\nAll naked, to fulfil their foul delight;\nAnd in their father's blood they made them dance\nUpon the pavement, -- God give them mischance.\nFor which these woeful maidens, full of dread,\nRather than they would lose their maidenhead,\nThey privily *be start* into a well,                    *suddenly leaped\nAnd drowned themselves, as the bookes tell.\nThey of Messene let inquire and seek\nOf Lacedaemon fifty maidens eke,\nOn which they woulde do their lechery:\nBut there was none of all that company\nThat was not slain, and with a glad intent\nChose rather for to die, than to assent\nTo be oppressed* of her maidenhead.                     *forcibly bereft\nWhy should I then to dien be in dread?\nLo, eke the tyrant Aristoclides,\nThat lov'd a maiden hight Stimphalides,\nWhen that her father slain was on a night,\nUnto Diana's temple went she right,\nAnd hent* the image in her handes two,                  *caught, clasped\nFrom which image she woulde

wife,\nThat at Carthage bereft herself of life?\nFor, when she saw the Romans win the town,\nShe took her children all, and skipt adown\nInto the fire, and rather chose to die,\nThan any Roman did her

as touching this mattere.\nWhen Abradate was slain, his wife so dear <23>\nHerselfe slew, and let her blood to glide\nIn Abradate's woundes, deep and wide,\nAnd said, 'My body at the leaste way\nThere shall no wight defoul, if that I may.'\nWhy should I more examples hereof sayn?\nSince that so many have themselves slain,\nWell rather than they would defouled be,\nI will conclude that it is bet*

The authenticity of the prologue is questionable. It is found in\none manuscript only; other manuscripts give other prologues,\nmore plainly not Chaucer's than this; and some manuscripts\nhave merely a colophon to the effect that \"Here endeth the\nFranklin's Tale and beginneth the Physician's Tale without a\nprologue.\" The Tale itself is the well-known story of Virginia,\nwith several departures from the text of Livy. Chaucer probably\nfollowed the \"Romance of the Rose\" and Gower's \"Confessio\nAmantis,\" in both of which the story is found.\n\n\nTHE TALE.\n\n\nThere was, as telleth Titus Livius, <1>\nA knight, that called was Virginius,\nFull filled of honour and worthiness,\nAnd strong of friendes, and of great richess.\nThis knight one daughter hadde by his wife;\nNo children had he more in all his life.\nFair was this maid in excellent beauty\nAboven ev'ry wight that man may see:\nFor nature had with sov'reign diligence\nY-formed her in so great excellence,\nAs though she woulde say, \"Lo, I, Nature,\nThus can I form and paint a creature,\nWhen that me list; who can me counterfeit?\nPygmalion? not though he aye forge and beat,\nOr grave or painte: for I dare well sayn,\nApelles, Zeuxis, shoulde work in vain,\nEither to grave, or paint, or forge, or beat,\nIf they presumed me to counterfeit.\nFor he that is the former principal,\nHath made me his vicar-general\nTo form and painten earthly creatures\nRight as me list, and all thing in my cure* is,                    *care\nUnder the moone, that may wane and wax.\nAnd for my work right nothing will I ax*                            *ask\nMy lord and I be full of one accord.\nI made her to the worship* of my lord;\nSo do I all mine other creatures,\nWhat colour that they have, or what figures.\"\nThus seemeth me that Nature woulde say.\n\nThis maiden was of age twelve year and tway,*                       *two\nIn which that Nature hadde such delight.\nFor right as she can paint a lily white,\nAnd red a rose, right with such painture\nShe painted had this noble creature,\nEre she was born, upon her limbes free,\nWhere as by right such colours shoulde be:\nAnd Phoebus dyed had her tresses great,\nLike to the streames* of his burned heat.                   *beams, rays\nAnd if that excellent was her beauty,\nA thousand-fold more virtuous was she.\nIn her there lacked no condition,\nThat is to praise, as by discretion.\nAs well in ghost* as body chaste was she:                  *mind, spirit\nFor which she flower'd in virginity,\nWith all humility and abstinence,\nWith alle temperance and patience,\nWith measure* eke of bearing and array.                      *moderation\nDiscreet she was in answering alway,\nThough she were wise as Pallas, dare I sayn;\nHer faconde* eke full womanly and plain,                     *speech <2>\nNo counterfeited termes hadde she\nTo seeme wise; but after her degree\nShe spake, and all her worde's more and less\nSounding in virtue and in gentleness.\nShamefast she was in maiden's shamefastness,\nConstant in heart, and ever *in business*              *diligent, eager*\nTo drive her out of idle sluggardy:\nBacchus had of her mouth right no mast'ry.\nFor wine and slothe <3> do Venus increase,\nAs men in fire will casten oil and grease.\nAnd of her owen virtue, unconstrain'd,\nShe had herself full often sick y-feign'd,\nFor that she woulde flee the company,\nWhere likely was to treaten of folly,\nAs is at feasts, at revels, and at dances,\nThat be occasions of dalliances.\nSuch thinges make children for to be\nToo soone ripe and bold, as men may see,\nWhich is full perilous, and hath been yore;*                     *of old\nFor all too soone may she learne lore\nOf boldeness, when that she is a wife.\n\nAnd ye mistresses,* in your olde life              *governesses, duennas\nThat lordes' daughters have in governance,\nTake not of my wordes displeasance\nThinke that ye be set in governings\nOf lordes' daughters only for two things;\nEither for ye have kept your honesty,\nOr else for ye have fallen in frailty\nAnd knowe well enough the olde dance,\nAnd have forsaken fully such meschance*                  *wickedness <4>\nFor evermore;

Saint Helen, according to Sir John Mandeville, found the\ncross of Christ deep below ground, under a rock, where the\nJews had hidden it; and she tested the genuineness of the sacred\ntree, by raising to life a dead man laid upon it.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHIPMAN'S TALE.<1>\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE\n\n\nOur Host upon his stirrups stood anon,\nAnd saide; \"Good men, hearken every one,\nThis was a thrifty* tale for the nones.            *discreet, profitable\nSir Parish Priest,\" quoth he, \"for Godde's bones,\nTell us a tale, as was thy *forword yore:*            *promise formerly*\nI see well that ye learned men in lore\nCan* muche good, by Godde's dignity.\"                              *know\nThe Parson him answer'd, \"Ben'dicite!\nWhat ails the man, so sinfully to swear?\"\nOur Host answer'd, \"O Jankin, be ye there?\nNow, good men,\" quoth our Host, \"hearken to me.\nI smell a Lollard <2> in the wind,\" quoth he.\n\"Abide, for Godde's digne* passion,                              *worthy\nFor we shall have a predication:\nThis Lollard here will preachen us somewhat.\"\n\"Nay, by my father's soul, that shall he not,\nSaide the Shipman; \"Here shall he not preach,\nHe shall no gospel glose* here nor teach.                  *comment upon\nWe all believe in the great God,\" quoth he.\n\"He woulde sowe some difficulty,\nOr springe cockle <3> in our cleane corn.\nAnd therefore, Host, I warne thee beforn,\nMy jolly body shall a tale tell,\nAnd I shall clinke you so merry a bell,\nThat I shall waken all this company;\nBut it shall not be of philosophy,\nNor of physic, nor termes quaint of law;\nThere is but little Latin in my maw.\"*                            *belly\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Shipman's Tale\n\n\n1. The Prologue here given was transferred by Tyrwhitt from\nthe place, preceding the Squire's Tale, which it had formerly\noccupied; the Shipman's Tale having no Prologue in the best\nmanuscripts.\n\n2. Lollard: A contemptuous name for the followers of\nWyckliffe; presumably derived from the Latin, \"lolium,\" tares,\nas if they were the tares among the Lord's wheat; so, a few lines\nbelow, the Shipman intimates his fear lest the Parson should\n\"spring cockle in our clean corn.\"\n\n3. Cockle: A weed, the \"Agrostemma githago\" of Linnaeus;\nperhaps named from the Anglo-Saxon, \"ceocan,\" because it\nchokes the corn.\n(Transcriber's note: It is also possible Chaucer had in mind\nMatthew 13:25, where in some translations, an enemy sowed\n\"cockle\" amongst the wheat. (Other translations have \"tares\"\nand \"darnel\".))\n\n\nTHE TALE. <1>\n\n\nA Merchant whilom dwell'd at Saint Denise,\nThat riche was, for which men held him wise.\nA wife he had of excellent beauty,\nAnd *companiable and revellous* was she,            *fond of society and\nWhich is a thing that causeth more dispence                merry making*\nThan worth is all the cheer and reverence\nThat men them do at feastes and at dances.\nSuch salutations and countenances\nPassen, as doth the shadow on the wall;\nPut woe is him that paye must for all.\nThe sely* husband algate** he must pay,               *innocent **always\nHe must us <2> clothe and he must us array\nAll for his owen worship richely:\nIn which array we dance jollily.\nAnd if that he may not, paraventure,\nOr elles list not such dispence endure,\nBut thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,\nThen must another paye for our cost,\nOr lend us gold, and that is perilous.\n\nThis noble merchant held a noble house;\nFor which he had all day so great repair,*           *resort of visitors\nFor his largesse, and for his wife was fair,\nThat wonder is;

In this Tale Chaucer seems to have followed an old French\nstory, which also formed the groundwork of the first story in\nthe eighth day of the \"Decameron.\"\n\n2. \"He must us clothe\": So in all the manuscripts and from this\nand the following lines, it must be inferred that Chaucer had\nintended to put the Tale in  the mouth of a female speaker.\n\n3. Dan: a title bestowed on priests and scholars; from\n\"Dominus,\" like the Spanish \"Don\".\n\n4. Bruges was in Chaucer's time the great emporium of\nEuropean commerce.\n\n5. The monk had been appointed by his abbot to inspect and\nmanage the rural property of the monastery.\n\n6. Malvesie or Malmesy wine derived its name from Malvasia, a\nregion of the Morea near Cape Malea, where it was made, as it\nalso was on Chios and some other Greek islands. Vernage was\n\"vernaccia\", a sweet Italian wine.\n\n 7. Contour-house: counting-house; French, \"comptoir.\"\n\n8. Under the yarde: under the rod; in pupillage; a phrase\nproperly used of children, but employed by the Clerk in the\nprologue to his tale.  See note 1 to the Prologue to the Clerk's\nTale.\n\n9. Genelon, Ganelon, or Ganilion; one of Charlemagne's\nofficers, whose treachery was the cause of the disastrous defeat\nof the Christians by the Saracens at Roncevalles; he was torn to\npieces by four horses.\n\n10. Elenge:  From French, \"eloigner,\" to remove; it may mean\neither the lonely, cheerless condition of the priest, or the strange\nbehaviour of the merchant in leaving him to himself.\n\n11. Make a chevisance: raise money by means of a borrowing\nagreement; from French,  \"achever,\" to finish; the general\nmeaning of the word is a bargain, an agreement.\n\n\n\nTHE PRIORESS'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\n\"WELL said, by *corpus Domini,\"* quoth our Host;       *the Lord's body*\n\"Now longe may'st thou saile by the coast,\nThou gentle Master, gentle Marinere.\nGod give the monk *a thousand last quad year!*   *ever so much evil* <1>\nAha! fellows, beware of such a jape.*                             *trick\nThe monk *put in the manne's hood an ape,*                  *fooled him*\nAnd in his wife's eke, by Saint Austin.\nDrawe no monkes more into your inn.\nBut now pass over, and let us seek about,\nWho shall now telle first of all this rout\nAnother tale;\" and with that word he said,\nAs courteously as it had been a maid;\n\"My Lady Prioresse, by your leave,\nSo that I wist I shoulde you not grieve,*                        *offend\nI woulde deeme* that ye telle should                      *judge, decide\nA tale next, if so were that ye would.\nNow will ye vouchesafe, my lady dear?\"\n\"Gladly,\" quoth she; and said as ye shall hear.\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Prioress's Tale.\n\n\n1.

Tales of the murder of children by Jews were frequent in the\nMiddle Ages, being probably designed to keep up the bitter\nfeeling of the Christians against the Jews. Not a few children\nwere canonised on this account; and the scene of the misdeeds\nwas laid anywhere and everywhere, so that Chaucer could be at\nno loss for material.\n\n2. This is from Psalm viii. 1, \"Domine, dominus noster,quam\nadmirabile est nomen tuum in universa terra.\"\n\n3. \"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast Thou\nordained strength.\" -- Psalms viii. 2.\n\n4. The ghost that in thee light: the spirit that on thee alighted;\nthe Holy Ghost through whose power Christ was conceived.\n\n5. Jewery: A quarter which the Jews were permitted to inhabit;\nthe Old Jewry in London got its name in this way.\n\n6. St. Nicholas, even in his swaddling clothes -- so says the\n\"Breviarium Romanum\" --gave promise of extraordinary virtue\nand holiness; for, though he sucked freely on other days, on\nWednesdays and Fridays he applied to the breast only once, and\nthat not until the evening.\n\n7. \"O Alma Redemptoris Mater,\" (\"O soul mother of the\nRedeemer\") -- the beginning of a hymn to the Virgin.\n\n8. Antiphonere: A book of anthems, or psalms, chanted in the\nchoir by alternate verses.\n\n9. Souded; confirmed; from French, \"soulde;\" Latin, \"solidatus.\"\n\n10. \"And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and\nbefore the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn\nthat song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which\nwere redeemed from the earth.\nThese are they which were not defiled with women; for they are\nvirgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he\ngoeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the\nfirstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.\"\n-- Revelations xiv. 3, 4.\n\n11. Freined: asked, inquired; from Anglo-Saxon, \"frinan,\"\n\"fraegnian.\" Compare German, \"fragen.\"\n\n12. Halse:  embrace or salute; implore: from Anglo-Saxon\n\"hals,\" the neck.\n\n14 A boy said to have been slain by the Jews at Lincoln in 1255,\naccording to Matthew Paris.  Many popular ballads were made\nabout the event, which the diligence of the Church doubtless\nkept fresh in mind at Chaucer's day.\n\n\n\nCHAUCER'S TALE OF SIR THOPAS.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.<1>\n\n\nWHEN said was this miracle, every man\nAs sober* was, that wonder was to see,                          *serious\nTill that our Host to japen* he began,                     *talk lightly\nAnd then *at erst* he looked upon me,               *for the first time*\nAnd saide thus; \"What man art thou?\" quoth he;\n\"Thou lookest as thou wouldest find an hare,\nFor ever on the ground I see thee stare.\n\n\"Approache near, and look up merrily.\nNow ware you, Sirs, and let this man have place.\nHe in the waist is shapen as well as I; <2>\nThis were a puppet in an arm t'embrace\nFor any woman small and fair of face.\nHe seemeth elvish* by his countenance,                    *surly, morose\nFor unto no wight doth he dalliance.\n\n\"Say now somewhat, since other folk have said;\nTell us a tale of mirth, and that anon.\"\n\"Hoste,\" quoth I, \"be not evil apaid,*                     *dissatisfied\nFor other tale certes can* I none,                                 *know\nEut of a rhyme I learned yore* agone.\"                             *long\n\"Yea, that is good,\" quoth he; \"now shall we hear\nSome dainty thing, me thinketh by thy cheer.\"*         *expression, mien\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to Chaucer's Tale of Sir Thopas\n\n\n1. This prologue is interesting, for the picture which it gives of\nChaucer himself; riding apart from and indifferent to the rest of\nthe pilgrims, with eyes fixed on the ground, and an \"elvish\",\nmorose, or rather self-absorbed air; portly, if not actually stout,\nin body; and evidently a man out of the common, as the closing\nwords of the Host imply.\n\n2.

It is full of phrases\ntaken from the popular rhymesters in the vein which he holds up\nto ridicule; if, indeed -- though of that there is no evidence -- it\nbe not actually part of an old romance which Chaucer selected\nand reproduced to point his assault on the prevailing taste in\nliterature.\nTranscriber's note: The Tale is full of incongruities of every\nkind, which Purves does not refer to; I point some of them out\nin the notes which follow - marked TN.\n\n2.

Drafty:  worthless, vile; no better than draff or dregs; from\nthe Anglo-Saxon, \"drifan\" to drive away, expel.\n\n\nTHE TALE.<1>\n\n\nA young man called Meliboeus, mighty and rich, begat upon his\nwife, that called was Prudence, a daughter which that called was\nSophia. Upon a day befell, that he for his disport went into the\nfields him to play.  His wife and eke his daughter hath he left\nwithin his house, of which the doors were fast shut. Three of his\nold foes have it espied, and set ladders to the walls of his house,\nand by the windows be entered, and beaten his wife, and\nwounded his daughter with five mortal wounds, in five sundry\nplaces; that is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her\nnose, and in her mouth; and left her for dead, and went away.\nWhen Meliboeus returned was into his house, and saw all this\nmischief, he, like a man mad, rending his clothes, gan weep and\ncry. Prudence his wife, as farforth as she durst, besought him of\nhis weeping for to stint: but not forthy [notwithstanding] he gan\nto weep and cry ever longer the more.\n\nThis noble wife Prudence remembered her upon the sentence of\nOvid, in his book that called is the \"Remedy of Love,\" <2>\nwhere he saith: He is a fool that disturbeth the mother to weep\nin the death of her child, till she have wept her fill, as for a\ncertain time; and then shall a man do his diligence with amiable\nwords her to recomfort and pray her of her weeping for to stint\n[cease]. For which reason this noble wife Prudence suffered her\nhusband for to weep and cry, as for a certain space; and when\nshe saw her time, she said to him in this wise: \"Alas! my lord,\"\nquoth she, \"why make ye yourself for to be like a fool? For\nsooth it appertaineth not to a wise man to make such a sorrow.\nYour daughter, with the grace of God, shall warish [be cured]\nand escape. And all [although] were it so that she right now\nwere dead, ye ought not for her death yourself to destroy.\nSeneca saith, 'The wise man shall not take too great discomfort\nfor the death of his children, but certes he should suffer it in\npatience, as well as he abideth the death of his own proper\nperson.'\"\n\nMeliboeus answered anon and said: \"What man,\" quoth he,\n\"should of his weeping stint, that hath so great a cause to weep?\nJesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus\nhis friend.\"  Prudence answered, \"Certes, well I wot,\nattempered [moderate] weeping is nothing defended [forbidden]\nto him that sorrowful is, among folk in sorrow but it is rather\ngranted him to weep.  The Apostle Paul unto the Romans\nwriteth, 'Man shall rejoice with them that make joy, and weep\nwith such folk as weep.'  But though temperate weeping be\ngranted, outrageous weeping certes is defended. Measure of\nweeping should be conserved,  after the lore [doctrine] that\nteacheth us Seneca.  'When that thy friend is dead,' quoth he, 'let\nnot thine eyes too moist be of tears, nor too much dry: although\nthe tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall.  And when thou\nhast forgone [lost] thy friend, do diligence to get again another\nfriend: and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend\nwhich that thou hast lorn [lost] for therein is no boot\n[advantage].  And therefore if ye govern you by sapience, put\naway sorrow out of your heart. Remember you that Jesus\nSirach saith, 'A man that is joyous and glad in heart, it him\nconserveth flourishing in his age: but soothly a sorrowful heart\nmaketh his bones dry.'  He said eke thus, 'that sorrow in heart\nslayth full many a man.' Solomon  saith 'that right as moths in\nthe sheep's fleece annoy [do injury] to the clothes, and the small\nworms to the tree, right so annoyeth sorrow to the heart of\nman.' Wherefore us ought as well in the death of our children,\nas in the loss of our goods temporal, have patience. Remember\nyou upon the patient Job, when he had lost his children and his\ntemporal substance, and in his body endured and received full\nmany a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus: 'Our Lord hath\ngiven it to me, our Lord hath bereft it me; right as our Lord\nwould, right so be it done; blessed be the name of our Lord.\"'\n\nTo these foresaid things answered Meliboeus unto his wife\nPrudence: \"All thy words,\" quoth he, \"be true, and thereto\n[also] profitable, but truly mine heart is troubled with this\nsorrow so grievously, that I know not what to do.\"  \"Let call,\"\nquoth Prudence, \"thy true friends all, and thy lineage, which be\nwise, and tell to them your case, and hearken what they say in\ncounselling, and govern you after their sentence [opinion].\nSolomon saith, 'Work all things by counsel, and thou shall never\nrepent.'\" Then, by counsel of his wife Prudence, this Meliboeus\nlet call [sent for] a great congregation of folk, as surgeons,\nphysicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies\nreconciled (as by their semblance) to his love and to his grace;\nand therewithal there come some of his neighbours, that did him\nreverence more for dread than for love, as happeneth oft. There\ncome also full many subtle flatterers, and wise advocates\nlearned in the law. And when these folk together assembled\nwere, this Meliboeus in sorrowful wise showed them his case,\nand by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bare\na cruel ire, ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and suddenly\ndesired that the war should begin, but nevertheless yet asked he\ntheir counsel in this matter. A surgeon, by licence and assent of\nsuch as were wise, up rose, and to Meliboeus said as ye may\nhear.  \"Sir,\" quoth he, \"as to us surgeons appertaineth, that we\ndo to every wight the best that we can, where as we be\nwithholden, [employed] and to our patient that we do no\ndamage; wherefore it happeneth many a time and oft, that when\ntwo men have wounded each other, one same surgeon healeth\nthem both; wherefore unto our art it is not pertinent to nurse\nwar, nor parties to support [take sides].  But certes, as to the\nwarishing [healing] of your daughter, albeit so that perilously\nshe be wounded, we shall do so attentive business from day to\nnight, that, with the grace of God, she shall be whole and\nsound, as soon as is possible.\" Almost right in the same wise the\nphysicians answered, save that they said a few words more: that\nright as maladies be cured by their contraries, right so shall man\nwarish war (by peace). His neighbours full of envy, his feigned\nfriends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers, made\nsemblance of weeping, and impaired and agregged [aggravated]\nmuch of this matter, in praising greatly Meliboeus of might, of\npower, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his\nadversaries: and said utterly, that he anon should wreak him on\nhis foes, and begin war.\n\nUp rose then an advocate that was wise, by leave and by\ncounsel of other that were wise, and said, \"Lordings, the need\n[business] for which we be assembled in this place, is a full\nheavy thing, and an high matter, because of the wrong and of\nthe wickedness that hath been done, and eke by reason of the\ngreat damages that in time coming be possible to fall for the\nsame cause, and eke by reason of the great riches and power of\nthe parties both; for which reasons, it were a full great peril to\nerr in this matter. Wherefore, Meliboeus, this is our sentence\n[opinion]; we counsel you, above all things, that right anon thou\ndo thy diligence in keeping of thy body, in such a wise that thou\nwant no espy  nor watch thy body to save. And after that, we\ncounsel that in thine house thou set sufficient garrison, so that\nthey may as well thy body as thy house defend. But, certes, to\nmove war or suddenly to do vengeance, we may not deem\n[judge] in so little time that it were profitable. Wherefore we\nask leisure and space to have deliberation in this case to deem;\nfor the common proverb saith thus; 'He that soon deemeth soon\nshall repent.' And eke men say, that that judge is wise, that soon\nunderstandeth a matter, and judgeth by leisure. For albeit so\nthat all tarrying be annoying, algates [nevertheless] it is no\nreproof [subject for reproach] in giving of judgement, nor in\nvengeance taking, when it is sufficient and, reasonable.  And\nthat shewed our Lord Jesus Christ by example; for when that\nthe woman that was taken in adultery was brought in his\npresence to know what should be done with her person, albeit\nthat he wist well himself what he would answer, yet would he\nnot answer suddenly, but he would have deliberation, and in the\nground he wrote twice. And by these causes we ask deliberation\nand we shall then by the grace of God counsel the thing that\nshall be profitable.\"\n\nUp started then the young folk anon at once, and the most part\nof that company have scorned these old wise men and begun to\nmake noise and said, \"Right as while that iron is hot men should\nsmite, right so men should wreak their wrongs while that they\nbe fresh and new:\"  and with loud voice they cried. \"War! War!\"\nUp rose then one of these old wise, and with his hand made\ncountenance [a sign, gesture] that men should hold them still,\nand give him audience. \"Lordings,\" quoth he, \"there is full many\na man that crieth, 'War! war!' that wot full little what war\namounteth.  War at his beginning hath so great an entering and\nso large, that every wight may enter when him liketh, and lightly\n[easily] find war: but certes what end shall fall thereof it is not\nlight to know. For soothly when war is once begun, there is full\nmany a child unborn of his mother, that shall sterve [die] young\nby cause of that war, or else live in sorrow and die in\nwretchedness; and therefore, ere that any war be begun, men\nmust have great counsel and great deliberation.\"  And when this\nold man weened [thought, intended] to enforce his tale by\nreasons, well-nigh all at once began they to rise for to break his\ntale, and bid him full oft his words abridge. For soothly he that\npreacheth to them that list not hear his words, his sermon them\nannoyeth. For Jesus Sirach saith, that music in weeping is a\nnoyous [troublesome] thing.  This is to say, as much availeth to\nspeak before folk to whom his speech annoyeth, as to sing\nbefore him that weepeth.  And when this wise man saw that him\nwanted audience, all shamefast he sat him down again.  For\nSolomon saith, 'Where as thou mayest have no audience,\nenforce thee not to speak.'  \"I  see well,\" quoth this wise man,\n\"that the common proverb is sooth, that good counsel wanteth,\nwhen it is most need.\" Yet [besides, further] had this Meliboeus\nin his council many folk, that privily in his ear counselled him\ncertain thing, and counselled him the contrary in general\naudience. When Meliboeus had heard that the greatest part of\nhis council were accorded [in agreement] that he should make\nwar, anon he consented to their counselling, and fully affirmed\ntheir sentence [opinion, judgement].\n\n(Dame Prudence, seeing her husband's resolution thus taken, in\nfull humble wise, when she saw her time, begins to counsel him\nagainst war, by a warning against haste in requital of either\ngood or evil.  Meliboeus tells her that he will not work by her\ncounsel, because he should be held a fool if he rejected for her\nadvice the opinion of so many wise men; because all women are\nbad; because it would seem that he had given her the mastery\nover him; and because she could not keep his secret, if he\nresolved to follow her advice. To these reasons Prudence\nanswers that it is no folly to change counsel when things, or\nmen's judgements of them, change -- especially to alter a\nresolution taken on the impulse of a great multitude of folk,\nwhere every man crieth and clattereth what him liketh; that if all\nwomen had been wicked, Jesus Christ would never have\ndescended to be born of a woman, nor have showed himself\nfirst to a woman after his resurrection and that when Solomon\nsaid he had found no good woman, he meant that God alone\nwas supremely good; <3> that her husband would not seem to\ngive her the mastery by following her counsel, for he had his\nown free choice in following or rejecting it; and that he knew\nwell and had often tested her great silence, patience, and\nsecrecy. And whereas he had quoted a saying, that in wicked\ncounsel women vanquish men, she reminds him that she would\ncounsel him against doing a wickedness on which he had set his\nmind, and cites instances to show that many women have been\nand yet are full good, and their counsel wholesome and\nprofitable. Lastly, she quotes the words of God himself, when\nhe was about to make woman as an help meet for man; and\npromises that, if her husband will trust her counsel, she will\nrestore to him his daughter whole and sound, and make him\nhave honour in this case.  Meliboeus answers that because of his\nwife's sweet words, and also because he has proved and assayed\nher great wisdom and her great truth, he will govern him by her\ncounsel in all things. Thus encouraged, Prudence enters on a\nlong discourse, full of learned citations, regarding the manner in\nwhich counsellors should be chosen and consulted, and the\ntimes and reasons for changing a counsel. First, God must be\nbesought for guidance. Then a man must well examine his own\nthoughts, of such things as he holds to be best for his own\nprofit; driving out of his heart anger, covetousness, and\nhastiness, which perturb and pervert the judgement. Then he\nmust keep his counsel secret, unless confiding it to another shall\nbe more profitable; but, in so confiding it, he shall say nothing\nto bias the mind of the counsellor toward flattery or\nsubserviency. After that he should consider his friends and his\nenemies, choosing of the former such as be most faithful and\nwise, and eldest and most approved in counselling; and even of\nthese only a few. Then he must eschew the counselling of fools,\nof flatterers, of his old enemies that be reconciled, of servants\nwho bear him great reverence and fear, of folk that be drunken\nand can hide no counsel, of such as counsel one thing privily\nand the contrary openly; and of young folk, for their counselling\nis not ripe. Then, in examining his counsel, he must truly tell his\ntale; he must consider whether the thing he proposes to do be\nreasonable, within his power, and acceptable to the more part\nand the better part of his counsellors; he must look at the things\nthat may follow from that counselling, choosing the best and\nwaiving all besides; he must consider the root whence the\nmatter of his counsel is engendered, what  fruits it may bear,\nand from what causes they be sprung.  And having thus\nexamined his counsel and approved it by many wise folk and\nold, he shall consider if he may perform it and make of it a good\nend; if he be in doubt, he shall choose rather to suffer than to\nbegin; but otherwise he shall prosecute his resolution steadfastly\ntill the enterprise be at an end. As to changing his counsel, a\nman may do so without reproach, if the cause cease, or when a\nnew case betides, or if he find that by error or otherwise harm\nor damage may result, or if his counsel be dishonest or come of\ndishonest cause, or if it be impossible or may not properly be\nkept; and he must take it for a general rule, that every counsel\nwhich is affirmed so strongly, that it may not be changed for\nany condition that may betide, that counsel is wicked.\nMeliboeus, admitting that his wife had spoken well and suitably\nas to counsellors and counsel in general, prays her to tell him in\nespecial what she thinks of the counsellors whom they have\nchosen in their present need. Prudence replies that his counsel in\nthis case could not properly be called a counselling, but a\nmovement of folly; and points out that he has erred in sundry\nwise against the rules which he had just laid down. Granting\nthat he has erred, Meliboeus says that he is all ready to change\nhis counsel right as she will devise; for, as the proverb runs, to\ndo sin is human, but to persevere long in sin is work of the\nDevil. Prudence then minutely recites, analyses, and criticises\nthe counsel given to her husband in the assembly of his friends.\nShe commends the advice of the physicians and surgeons, and\nurges that they should be well rewarded for their noble speech\nand their services in healing Sophia; and she asks Meliboeus\nhow he understands their proposition that one contrary must be\ncured by another contrary. Meliboeus answers, that he should\ndo vengeance on his enemies, who had done him wrong.\nPrudence, however, insists that vengeance is not the contrary of\nvengeance, nor wrong of wrong, but the like; and that\nwickedness should be healed by goodness, discord by accord,\nwar by peace.  She proceeds to deal with the counsel of the\nlawyers and wise folk that advised Meliboeus to take prudent\nmeasures for the security of his body and of his house. First, she\nwould have her husband pray for the protection and aid of\nChrist; then commit the keeping of his person to his true\nfriends; then suspect and avoid all strange folk, and liars, and\nsuch people as she had already warned him against; then beware\nof presuming on his strength, or the weakness of his adversary,\nand neglecting to guard his person -- for every wise man\ndreadeth his enemy; then he should evermore be on the watch\nagainst ambush and all espial, even in what seems a place of\nsafety; though he should not be so cowardly, as to fear where is\nno cause for dread; yet he should dread to be poisoned, and\ntherefore shun scorners, and fly their words as venom.  As to\nthe fortification of his house, she points out that towers and\ngreat edifices are costly and laborious, yet useless unless\ndefended by true friends that be old and wise; and the greatest\nand strongest garrison that a rich man may have, as well to keep\nhis person as his goods, is, that he be beloved by his subjects\nand by his neighbours. Warmly approving the counsel that in all\nthis business Meliboeus should proceed with great diligence and\ndeliberation, Prudence goes on to examine the advice given by\nhis neighbours that do him reverence without love, his old\nenemies reconciled, his flatterers that counselled him certain\nthings privily and openly counselled him the contrary, and the\nyoung folk that counselled him to avenge himself and make war\nat once.  She reminds him that he stands alone against three\npowerful enemies, whose kindred are numerous and close,\nwhile his are fewer and remote in relationship; that only the\njudge who has jurisdiction in a case may take sudden vengeance\non any man; that her husband's power does not accord with his\ndesire; and that, if he did take vengeance, it would only breed\nfresh wrongs and contests. As to the causes of the wrong done\nto him, she holds that God, the causer of all things, has\npermitted him to suffer because he has drunk so much honey\n<4> of sweet temporal riches, and delights, and honours of this\nworld, that he is drunken, and has forgotten Jesus Christ his\nSaviour; the three enemies of mankind, the flesh, the fiend, and\nthe world, have entered his heart by the windows of his body,\nand wounded his soul in five places -- that is to say, the deadly\nsins that have entered into his heart by the five senses; and in\nthe same manner Christ has suffered his three enemies to enter\nhis house by the windows, and wound his daughter in the five\nplaces before specified. Meliboeus demurs, that if his wife's\nobjections prevailed, vengeance would never be taken, and\nthence great mischiefs would arise; but Prudence replies that the\ntaking of vengeance lies with the judges, to whom the private\nindividual must have recourse.  Meliboeus declares that such\nvengeance does not please him, and that, as Fortune has\nnourished and helped him from his childhood, he will now assay\nher, trusting, with God's help, that she will aid him to avenge his\nshame. Prudence warns him against trusting to Fortune, all the\nless because she has hitherto favoured him, for just on that\naccount she is the more likely to fail him; and she calls on him\nto leave his vengeance with the Sovereign Judge, that avengeth\nall villainies and wrongs. Meliboeus argues that if he refrains\nfrom taking vengeance he will invite his enemies to do him\nfurther wrong, and he will be put and held over low; but\nPrudence contends that such a result can be brought about only\nby the neglect of the judges, not by the patience of the\nindividual.  Supposing that he had leave to avenge himself, she\nrepeats that he is not strong enough, and quotes the common\nsaw, that it is madness for a man to strive with a stronger than\nhimself, peril to strive with one of equal strength, and folly to\nstrive with a weaker. But, considering his own defaults and\ndemerits, -- remembering the patience of Christ and the\nundeserved tribulations of the saints, the brevity of this life with\nall its trouble and sorrow, the discredit thrown on the wisdom\nand training of  a man who cannot bear wrong with patience --\nhe should refrain wholly from taking vengeance. Meliboeus\nsubmits that he is not at all a perfect man, and his heart will\nnever be at peace until he is avenged; and that as his enemies\ndisregarded the peril when they attacked him, so he might,\nwithout reproach, incur some peril in attacking them in return,\neven though he did a great excess in avenging one wrong by\nanother. Prudence strongly deprecates all outrage or excess; but\nMeliboeus insists that he cannot see that it might greatly harm\nhim though he took a vengeance, for he is richer and mightier\nthan his enemies, and all things obey money. Prudence\nthereupon launches into a long dissertation on the advantages of\nriches, the evils of poverty, the means by which wealth should\nbe gathered, and the manner in which it should be used; and\nconcludes by counselling her husband not to move war and\nbattle through trust in his riches, for they suffice not to maintain\nwar, the battle is not always to the strong or the numerous, and\nthe perils of conflict are many. Meliboeus then curtly asks her\nfor her counsel how he shall do in this need; and she answers\nthat certainly she counsels him to agree with his adversaries and\nhave peace with them. Meliboeus on this cries out that plainly\nshe loves not his honour or his worship, in counselling him to\ngo and humble himself before his enemies, crying mercy to them\nthat, having done him so grievous wrong, ask him not to be\nreconciled. Then Prudence, making semblance of wrath, retorts\nthat she loves his honour and profit as she loves her own, and\never has done; she cites the Scriptures in support of her counsel\nto seek peace; and says she will leave him to his own courses,\nfor she knows well he is so stubborn, that he will do nothing for\nher. Meliboeus then relents; admits that he is angry and cannot\njudge aright; and puts himself wholly in her hands, promising to\ndo just as she desires, and admitting that he is the more held to\nlove and praise her, if she reproves him of his folly)\n\nThen Dame Prudence discovered all her counsel and her will\nunto him, and said: \"I counsel you,\" quoth she, \"above all\nthings, that ye make peace between God and you, and be\nreconciled unto Him and to his grace; for, as I have said to you\nherebefore, God hath suffered you to have this tribulation and\ndisease [distress, trouble] for your sins; and if ye do as I say\nyou, God will send your adversaries unto you, and make them\nfall at your feet, ready to do your will and your commandment.\nFor Solomon saith, 'When the condition of man is pleasant and\nliking to God, he changeth the hearts of the man's adversaries,\nand constraineth them to beseech him of peace of grace.'  And I\npray you let me speak with your adversaries in privy place, for\nthey shall not know it is by your will or your assent; and then,\nwhen I know their will and their intent, I may counsel you the\nmore surely.\" '\"Dame,\" quoth Meliboeus, '\"do your will and\nyour liking, for I put me wholly in your disposition and\nordinance.\"\n\nThen Dame Prudence, when she saw the goodwill of her\nhusband, deliberated and took advice in herself, thinking how\nshe might bring this need [affair, emergency] unto a good end.\nAnd when she saw her time, she sent for these adversaries to\ncome into her into a privy place, and showed wisely into them\nthe great goods that come of peace, and the great harms and\nperils that be in war; and said to them, in goodly manner, how\nthat they ought have great repentance of the injuries and\nwrongs that they had done to Meliboeus her Lord, and unto her\nand her daughter.  And when they heard the goodly words of\nDame Prudence, then they were surprised and ravished, and had\nso great joy of her, that wonder was to tell.  \"Ah lady!\" quoth\nthey, \"ye have showed unto us the blessing of sweetness, after\nthe saying of David the prophet; for the reconciling which we\nbe not worthy to have in no manner, but we ought require it\nwith great contrition and humility, ye of your great goodness\nhave presented unto us. Now see we well, that the science and\nconning [knowledge] of Solomon is full true; for he saith, that\nsweet words multiply and increase friends, and make shrews\n[the ill-natured or angry] to be debonair [gentle, courteous] and\nmeek.  Certes we put our deed, and all our matter and cause, all\nwholly in your goodwill, and be ready to obey unto the speech\nand commandment of my lord Meliboeus. And therefore, dear\nand benign lady, we pray you and beseech you as meekly as we\ncan and may, that it like unto your great goodness to fulfil in\ndeed your goodly words. For we consider and acknowledge\nthat we have offended and grieved my lord Meliboeus out of\nmeasure, so far forth that we be not of power to make him\namends; and therefore we oblige and bind us and our friends to\ndo all his will and his commandment. But peradventure he hath\nsuch heaviness and such wrath to usward, [towards us] because\nof our offence, that he will enjoin us such a pain [penalty] as we\nmay not bear nor sustain; and therefore, noble lady, we beseech\nto your womanly pity to take such advisement [consideration]\nin this need, that we, nor our friends, be not disinherited and\ndestroyed through our folly.\"\n\n\"Certes,\" quoth Prudence, \"it is an hard thing, and right\nperilous, that a man put him all utterly in the arbitration and\njudgement and in the might and power of his enemy. For\nSolomon saith, 'Believe me, and give credence to that that I\nshall say: to thy son, to thy wife, to thy friend, nor to thy\nbrother, give thou never might nor mastery over thy body, while\nthou livest.'  Now, since he defendeth [forbiddeth] that a man\nshould not give to his brother, nor to his friend, the might of his\nbody, by a stronger reason he defendeth and forbiddeth a man\nto give himself to his enemy. And nevertheless, I counsel you\nthat ye mistrust not my lord: for I wot well and know verily,\nthat he is debonair and meek, large, courteous and nothing\ndesirous nor envious of good nor riches: for there is nothing in\nthis world that he desireth save only worship and honour.\nFurthermore I know well, and am right sure, that he shall\nnothing do in this need without counsel of me; and I shall so\nwork in this case, that by the grace of our Lord God ye shall be\nreconciled unto us.\"\n\nThen said they with one voice, \"\"Worshipful lady, we put us\nand our goods all fully in your will and disposition, and be ready\nto come, what day that it like unto your nobleness to limit us or\nassign us, for to make our obligation and bond, as strong as it\nliketh unto your goodness, that we may fulfil the will of you and\nof my lord Meliboeus.\"\n\nWhen Dame Prudence had heard the answer of these men, she\nbade them go again privily, and she returned to her lord\nMeliboeus, and told him how she found his adversaries full\nrepentant, acknowledging full lowly their sins and trespasses,\nand how they were ready to suffer all pain, requiring and\npraying him of mercy and pity. Then said Meliboeus, \"He is well\nworthy to have pardon and forgiveness of his sin, that excuseth\nnot his sin, but acknowledgeth, and repenteth him, asking\nindulgence.  For Seneca saith, 'There is the remission and\nforgiveness, where the confession is; for confession is neighbour\nto innocence.' And therefore I assent and confirm me to have\npeace, but it is good that we do naught without the assent and\nwill of our friends.\" Then was Prudence right glad and joyful,\nand said, \"Certes, Sir, ye be well and goodly advised; for right\nas by the counsel, assent, and help of your friends ye have been\nstirred to avenge you and make war, right so without their\ncounsel shall ye not accord you, nor have peace with your\nadversaries. For the law saith, 'There is nothing so good by way\nof kind, [nature] as a thing to be unbound by him that it was\nbound.'\"\n\nAnd then Dame Prudence, without delay or tarrying, sent anon\nher messengers for their kin and for their old friends, which\nwere true and wise; and told them by order, in the presence of\nMeliboeus, all this matter, as it is above expressed and declared;\nand prayed them that they would give their advice and counsel\nwhat were best to do in this need. And when Meliboeus' friends\nhad taken their advice and deliberation of the foresaid matter,\nand had examined it by great business and great diligence, they\ngave full counsel for to have peace and rest, and that Meliboeus\nshould with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness\nand mercy. And when Dame Prudence had heard the assent of\nher lord Meliboeus, and the counsel of his friends, accord with\nher will and her intention, she was wondrous glad in her heart,\nand said: \"There is an old proverb that saith, 'The goodness that\nthou mayest do this day, do it, and abide not nor delay it not till\nto-morrow:' and therefore I counsel you that ye send your\nmessengers, such as be discreet and wise, unto your adversaries,\ntelling them on your behalf, that if they will treat of peace and\nof accord, that they shape [prepare] them, without delay or\ntarrying, to come unto us.\" Which thing performed was indeed.\nAnd when these trespassers and repenting folk of their follies,\nthat is to say, the adversaries of Meliboeus, had heard what\nthese messengers said unto them, they were right glad and\njoyful, and answered full meekly and benignly, yielding graces\nand thanks to their lord Meliboeus, and to all his company; and\nshaped them without delay to go with the messengers, and obey\nto the commandment of their lord Meliboeus.  And right anon\nthey took their way to the court of Meliboeus, and took with\nthem some of their true friends, to make faith for them, and for\nto be their borrows [sureties].\n\nAnd when they were come to the presence of Meliboeus, he\nsaid to them these words; \"It stands thus,\" quoth Meliboeus,\n\"and sooth it is, that ye causeless, and without skill and reason,\nhave done great injuries and wrongs to me, and to my wife\nPrudence, and to my daughter also; for ye have entered into my\nhouse by violence, and have done such outrage, that all men\nknow well that ye have deserved the death: and therefore will I\nknow and weet of you, whether ye will put the punishing and\nchastising, and the vengeance of this outrage, in the will of me\nand of my wife, or ye will not?\" Then the wisest of them three\nanswered for them all, and said; \"Sir,\" quoth he, \"we know well,\nthat we be I unworthy to come to the court of so great a lord\nand so worthy as ye be, for we have so greatly mistaken us, and\nhave offended and aguilt [incurred guilt] in such wise against\nyour high lordship, that truly we have deserved the death. But\nyet for the great goodness and debonairte [courtesy, gentleness]\nthat all the world witnesseth of your person, we submit us to\nthe excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship, and be\nready to obey to all your commandments, beseeching you, that\nof your  merciable [merciful] pity ye will consider our great\nrepentance and low submission, and grant us forgiveness of our\noutrageous trespass and offence; for well we know, that your\nliberal grace and mercy stretch them farther into goodness, than\ndo our outrageous guilt and trespass into wickedness; albeit that\ncursedly [wickedly] and damnably we have aguilt [incurred\nguilt] against your high lordship.\" Then Meliboeus took them\nup from the ground full benignly, and received their obligations\nand their bonds, by their oaths upon their pledges and borrows,\n[sureties] and assigned them a certain day to return unto his\ncourt for to receive and accept sentence and judgement, that\nMeliboeus would command to be done on them, by the causes\naforesaid; which things ordained, every man returned home to\nhis house.\n\nAnd when that Dame Prudence saw her time she freined\n[inquired] and asked her lord Meliboeus, what vengeance he\nthought to take of his adversaries. To which Meliboeus\nanswered, and said; \"Certes,\" quoth he, \"I think and purpose me\nfully to disinherit them of all that ever they have, and for to put\nthem in exile for evermore.\" \"Certes,\" quoth Dame Prudence,\n\"this were a cruel sentence, and much against reason. For ye be\nrich enough, and have no need of other men's goods; and ye\nmight lightly [easily] in this wise get you a covetous name,\nwhich is a vicious thing, and ought to be eschewed of every\ngood man: for, after the saying of the Apostle, covetousness is\nroot of all harms. And therefore it were better for you to lose\nmuch good of your own, than for to take of their good in this\nmanner. For better it is to lose good with worship [honour],\nthan to win good with villainy and shame. And every man ought\nto do his diligence and his business to get him a good name.\nAnd yet [further] shall he not only busy him in keeping his good\nname, but he shall also enforce him alway to do some thing by\nwhich he may renew his good name; for it is written, that the\nold good los [reputation <5>] of a man is soon gone and\npassed, when it is not renewed.  And as touching that ye say,\nthat ye will exile your adversaries, that thinketh ye much against\nreason, and out of measure, [moderation] considered the power\nthat they have given you upon themselves. And it is written,\nthat he is worthy to lose his privilege, that misuseth the might\nand the power that is given him.  And I set case [if I assume] ye\nmight enjoin them that pain by right and by law (which I trow\nye may not do), I say, ye might not put it to execution\nperadventure, and then it were like to return to the war, as it\nwas before.  And therefore if ye will that men do you obeisance,\nye must deem [decide] more courteously, that is to say, ye must\ngive more easy sentences and judgements. For it is written, 'He\nthat most courteously commandeth, to him men most obey.'\nAnd therefore I pray you, that in this necessity and in this need\nye cast you [endeavour, devise a way] to overcome your heart.\nFor Seneca saith, that he that overcometh his heart, overcometh\ntwice. And Tullius saith, 'There is nothing so commendable in a\ngreat lord, as when he is debonair and meek, and appeaseth him\nlightly [easily].' And I pray you, that ye will now forbear to do\nvengeance, in such a manner, that your good name may be kept\nand conserved, and that men may have cause and matter to\npraise you of pity and of mercy; and that ye have no cause to\nrepent you of thing that ye do. For Seneca saith, 'He\novercometh in an evil manner, that repenteth him of his victory.'\nWherefore I pray you let mercy be in your heart, to the effect\nand intent that God Almighty have mercy upon you in his last\njudgement; for Saint James saith in his Epistle, 'Judgement\nwithout mercy shall be done to him, that hath no mercy of\nanother wight.'\"\n\nWhen Meliboeus had heard the great skills [arguments, reasons]\nand reasons of Dame Prudence, and her wise information and\nteaching, his heart gan incline to the will of his wife, considering\nher true intent, he conformed him anon and assented fully to\nwork after her counsel, and thanked God, of whom proceedeth\nall goodness and all virtue, that him sent a wife of so great\ndiscretion. And when the day came that his adversaries should\nappear in his presence, he spake to them full goodly, and said in\nthis wise; \"Albeit so, that of your pride and high presumption\nand folly, an of your negligence and unconning, [ignorance] ye\nhave misborne [misbehaved] you, and trespassed [done injury]\nunto me, yet forasmuch as I see and behold your great humility,\nand that ye be sorry and repentant of your guilts, it constraineth\nme to do you grace and mercy. Wherefore I receive you into my\ngrace, and forgive you utterly all the offences, injuries, and\nwrongs, that ye have done against me and mine, to this effect\nand to this end, that God of his endless mercy will at the time of\nour dying forgive us our guilts, that we have trespassed to him\nin this wretched world; for doubtless, if we be sorry and\nrepentant of the sins and guilts which we have trespassed in the\nsight of our Lord God, he is so free and so merciable [merciful],\nthat he will forgive us our guilts, and bring us to the bliss that\nnever hath end.\" Amen.\n\n\nNotes to Chaucer's Tale of Meliboeus.\n\n\n1. The Tale of Meliboeus is literally translated from a French\nstory, or rather \"treatise,\" in prose, entitled \"Le Livre de\nMelibee et de Dame Prudence,\" of which two manuscripts, both\ndating from the fifteenth century, are preserved in the British\nMuseum. Tyrwhitt, justly enough, says of it that it is indeed, as\nChaucer called it in the prologue, \"'a moral tale virtuous,' and\nwas probably much esteemed in its time; but, in this age of\nlevity, I doubt some readers will be apt to regret that he did not\nrather give us the remainder of Sir Thopas.\"  It has been\nremarked that in the earlier portion of the Tale, as it left the\nhand of the poet, a number of blank verses were intermixed;\nthough this peculiarity of style, noticeable in any case only in\nthe first 150 or 200 lines, has necessarily all but disappeared by\nthe changes of spelling made in the modern editions. The\nEditor's purpose being to present to the public not \"The\nCanterbury Tales\" merely, but \"The Poems of Chaucer,\" so far\nas may be consistent with the limits of this volume, he has\ncondensed the long reasonings and learned quotations of Dame\nPrudence into a mere outline, connecting those portions of the\nTale wherein lies so much of story as it actually possesses, and\nthe general reader will probably not regret the sacrifice, made in\nthe view of retaining so far as possible the completeness of the\nTales, while lessening the intrusion of prose into a volume or\npoems.  The good wife of Meliboeus literally overflows with\nquotations from David, Solomon, Jesus the Son of Sirach, the\nApostles, Ovid, Cicero, Seneca, Cassiodorus, Cato, Petrus\nAlphonsus -- the converted Spanish Jew, of the twelfth century,\nwho wrote the \"Disciplina Clericalis\"  -- and other authorities;\nand in some passages, especially where husband and wife debate\nthe merits or demerits of women, and where Prudence dilates\non the evils of poverty, Chaucer only reproduces much that had\nbeen said already in the Tales that preceded -- such as the\nMerchant's and the Man of Law's.\n\n2. The lines which follow are a close translation of the original\nLatin, which reads:\n     \"Quis matrem, nisi mentis inops, in funere nati\n      Flere vetet? non hoc illa monenda loco.\n      Cum dederit lacrymas, animumque expleverit aegrum,\n      Ille dolor verbis emoderandus erit.\"\nOvid, \"Remedia Amoris,\" 127-131.\n\n3. See the conversation between Pluto and Proserpine, in the\nMerchant's Tale.\n\n4. \"Thy name,\" she says, \"is Meliboeus; that is to say, a man\nthat drinketh honey.\"\n\n5. Los: reputation; from the past participle of the Anglo-Saxon,\n\"hlisan\" to celebrate. Compare Latin, \"laus.\"\n\n\n\nTHE MONK'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE\n\n\nWHEN ended was my tale of Melibee,\nAnd of Prudence and her benignity,\nOur Hoste said, \"As I am faithful man,\nAnd by the precious corpus Madrian,<1>\nI had lever* than a barrel of ale,                               *rather\nThat goode lefe* my wife had heard this tale;                      *dear\nFor she is no thing of such patience\nAs was this Meliboeus' wife Prudence.\nBy Godde's bones! when I beat my knaves\nShe bringeth me the greate clubbed staves,\nAnd crieth, 'Slay the dogges every one,\nAnd break of them both back and ev'ry bone.'\nAnd if that any neighebour of mine\nWill not in church unto my wife incline,\nOr be so hardy to her to trespace,*                              *offend\nWhen she comes home she rampeth* in my face,                    *springs\nAnd crieth, 'False coward, wreak* thy wife                       *avenge\nBy corpus Domini, I will have thy knife,\nAnd thou shalt have my distaff, and go spin.'\nFrom day till night right thus she will begin.\n 'Alas!' she saith, 'that ever I was shape*                    *destined\nTo wed a milksop, or a coward ape,\nThat will be overlad* with every wight!                      *imposed on\nThou darest not stand by thy wife's right.'\n\n\"This is my life, *but if* that I will fight;                    *unless\nAnd out at door anon I must me dight,*                    *betake myself\nOr elles I am lost, but if that I\nBe, like a wilde lion, fool-hardy.\nI wot well she will do* me slay some day                           *make\nSome neighebour and thenne *go my way;*                 *take to flight*\nFor I am perilous with knife in hand,\nAlbeit that I dare not her withstand;\nFor she is big in armes, by my faith!\nThat shall he find, that her misdoth or saith. <2>\nBut let us pass away from this mattere.\nMy lord the Monk,\" quoth he, \"be merry of cheer,\nFor ye shall tell a tale truely.\nLo, Rochester stands here faste by.\nRide forth, mine owen lord, break not our game.\nBut by my troth I cannot tell your name;\nWhether shall I call you my lord Dan John,\nOr Dan Thomas, or elles Dan Albon?\nOf what house be ye, by your father's kin?\nI vow to God, thou hast a full fair skin;\nIt is a gentle pasture where thou go'st;\nThou art not like a penant* or a ghost.                        *penitent\nUpon my faith thou art some officer,\nSome worthy sexton, or some cellarer.\nFor by my father's soul, *as to my dome,*              *in my judgement*\nThou art a master when thou art at home;\nNo poore cloisterer, nor no novice,\nBut a governor, both wily and wise,\nAnd therewithal, of brawnes* and of bones,                       *sinews\nA right well-faring person for the nonce.\nI pray to God give him confusion\nThat first thee brought into religion.\nThou would'st have been a treade-fowl* aright;                     *cock\nHadst thou as greate leave, as thou hast might,\nTo perform all thy lust in engendrure,*          *generation, begettting\nThou hadst begotten many a creature.\nAlas! why wearest thou so wide a cope?

The Monk's Tale is founded in its main features on\nBocccacio's work, \"De Casibus Virorum Illustrium;\" (\"Stories\nof Illustrious Men\") but Chaucer has taken the separate stories\nof which it is composed from different authors, and dealt with\nthem after his own fashion.\n\n 2. Boccaccio opens his book with Adam, whose story is told at\nmuch greater length than here. Lydgate, in his translation from\nBoccaccio, speaks of Adam and Eve as made  \"of slime of the\nerth in Damascene the felde.\"\n\n3.  Judges xiii. 3. Boccaccio also tells the story of Samson; but\nChaucer seems, by his quotation a few lines below, to have\ntaken his version direct from the sacred book.\n\n4. Oliveres: olive trees; French, \"oliviers.\"\n\n5. \"Liber Judicum,\" the Book of Judges; chap. xv.\n\n6. Querne:  mill; from Anglo-Saxon, \"cyrran,\" to turn,\n\"cweorn,\" a mill,\n\n7.Harpies: the Stymphalian Birds, which fed on human flesh.\n\n8.  Busiris, king of Egypt, was wont to sacrifice all foreigners\ncoming to his dominions. Hercules was seized, bound, and led\nto the altar by his orders, but the hero broke his bonds and slew\nthe tyrant.\n\n9. The feats of Hercules here recorded are not all these known\nas the \"twelve labours;\" for instance, the cleansing of the\nAugean stables, and the capture of Hippolyte's girdle are not in\nthis list -- other and less famous deeds of the hero taking their\nplace. For this, however, we must accuse not Chaucer, but\nBoethius, whom he has almost literally translated, though with\nsome change of order.\n\n10. Trophee:  One of the manuscripts has a marginal reference\nto \"Tropheus vates Chaldaeorum\" (\"Tropheus the prophet of\nthe Chaldees\"); but it is not known what author Chaucer meant\n-- unless the reference is to a passage in the \"Filostrato\" of\nBoccaccio, on which Chaucer founded his \"Troilus and\nCressida,\" and which Lydgate mentions, under the name of\n\"Trophe,\" as having been translated by Chaucer.\n\n11. Pres: near; French, \"pres;\" the meaning seems to be, this\nnearer, lower world.\n\n12 Chaucer has taken the story of Zenobia from Boccaccio's\nwork \"De Claris Mulieribus.\" (\"Of Illustrious Women\")\n\n13.  Odenatus, who, for his services to the Romans, received\nfrom Gallienus the title of  \"Augustus;\" he was assassinated in\nA.D. 266 -- not, it was believed, without the connivance of\nZenobia, who succeeded him on the throne.\n\n14. Sapor was king of Persia, who made the Emperor Valerian\nprisoner, conquered Syria, and was pressing triumphantly\nwestward when he was met and defeated by Odenatus and\nZenobia.\n\n15. Aurelain became Emperor in A.D. 270.\n\n16. Vitremite:  The signification of this word,  which is spelled\nin several ways, is not known. Skinner's explanation, \"another\nattire,\" founded on the spelling \"autremite,\" is obviously\ninsufficient.\n\n17. Great part of this \"tragedy\" of Nero is really borrowed,\nhowever, from the \"Romance of the Rose.\"\n\n18. Trice:  thrust; from Anglo-Saxon, \"thriccan.\"\n\n19. So, in the Man of  Law's Tale, the Sultaness promises her\nson that she will \"reny her lay.\"\n\n20. As the \"tragedy\" of Holofernes is founded on the book of\nJudith, so is that of Antiochus on the Second Book of the\nMaccabees, chap. ix.\n\n21. By the insurgents under the leadership of Judas Maccabeus;\n2 Macc. chap. viii.\n\n22. Six:  the highest cast on a dicing-cube; here representing the\nhighest favour of fortune.\n\n23. Pompey had married his daughter Julia to Caesar; but she\ndied six years before Pompey's final overthrow.\n\n24. At the battle of Pharsalia, B.C. 48.\n\n25. Word and end: apparently a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon\nphrase, \"ord and end,\" meaning the whole, the beginning and\nthe end.\n\n26. At the opening of the story of Croesus, Chaucer has copied\nfrom his own translation of Boethius; but the story is mainly\ntaken from the \"Romance of the Rose\"\n\n27. \"This reflection,\" says Tyrwhttt, \"seems to have been\nsuggested by one which follows soon after the mention of\nCroesus in the passage just cited from Boethius. 'What other\nthing bewail the cryings of tragedies but only the deeds of\nfortune, that with an awkward stroke, overturneth the realms of\ngreat nobley?'\" --  in some manuscripts the four \"tragedies\" that\nfollow are placed between those of Zenobia and Nero; but\nalthough the general reflection with which the \"tragedy\" of\nCroesus closes might most appropriately wind up the whole\nseries, the general chronological arrangement which is observed\nin the other cases recommends the order followed in the text.\nBesides, since, like several other Tales, the Monk's tragedies\nwere cut short by the impatience of the auditors, it is more\nnatural that the Tale should close abruptly, than by such a\nrhetorical finish as these lines afford.\n\n28. Pedro the Cruel, King of Aragon, against whom his brother\nHenry rebelled. He was by false pretences inveigled into his\nbrother's tent, and treacherously slain. Mr Wright has remarked\nthat \"the cause of Pedro, though he was no better than a cruel\nand reckless tyrant, was popular in England from the very\ncircumstance that Prince Edward (the Black Prince) had\nembarked in it.\"\n\n29. Not the Oliver of Charlemagne -- but a traitorous Oliver of\nArmorica, corrupted by a bribe. Ganilion was the betrayer of\nthe Christian army at Roncevalles (see note 9 to the Shipman's\nTale); and his name appears to have been for a long time used in\nFrance to denote a traitor. Duguesclin, who betrayed Pedro into\nhis brother's tent, seems to be intended by the term \"Ganilion\nOliver,\" but if so, Chaucer has mistaken his name, which was\nBertrand -- perhaps confounding him, as Tyrwhttt suggests,\nwith Oliver du Clisson, another illustrious Breton of those\ntimes, who was also Constable of France, after Duguesclin. The\narms of the latter are supposed to be described a little above\n\n30. Pierre de Lusignan, King of Cyprus, who captured\nAlexandria in 1363 (see note 6 to the Prologue to the Tales).\nHe was assassinated in 1369.\n\n31. Bernabo Visconti, Duke of Milan, was deposed and\nimprisoned by his nephew, and died a captive in 1385. His death\nis the latest historical fact mentioned in the Tales; and thus it\nthrows the date of their composition to about the sixtieth year\nof Chaucer's age.\n\n32. The story of Ugolino is told in the 33rd Canto of the\n\"Inferno.\"\n\n\n\nTHE NUN'S PRIEST'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\n\"Ho!\" quoth the Knight, \"good sir, no more of this;\nThat ye have said is right enough, y-wis,*                  *of a surety\nAnd muche more; for little heaviness\nIs right enough to muche folk, I guess.\nI say for me, it is a great disease,*     *source of distress, annoyance\nWhere as men have been in great wealth and ease,\nTo hearen of their sudden fall, alas!\nAnd the contrary is joy and great solas,*              *delight, comfort\nAs when a man hath been in poor estate,\nAnd climbeth up, and waxeth fortunate,\nAnd there abideth in prosperity;\nSuch thing is gladsome, as it thinketh me,\nAnd of such thing were goodly for to tell.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" quoth our Hoste, \"by Saint Paule's bell.\nYe say right sooth; this monk hath clapped* loud;                *talked\nHe spake how Fortune cover'd with a cloud\nI wot not what, and als' of a tragedy\nRight now ye heard: and pardie no remedy\nIt is for to bewaile, nor complain\nThat that is done, and also it is pain,\nAs ye have said, to hear of heaviness.\nSir Monk, no more of this, so God you bless;\nYour tale annoyeth all this company;\nSuch talking is not worth a butterfly,\nFor therein is there no sport nor game;\nTherefore, Sir Monke, Dan Piers by your name,\nI pray you heart'ly, tell us somewhat else,\nFor sickerly, n'ere* clinking of your bells,        *were it not for the\nThat on your bridle hang on every side,\nBy heaven's king, that for us alle died,\nI should ere this have fallen down for sleep,\nAlthough the slough had been never so deep;\nThen had your tale been all told in vain.\nFor certainly, as these clerkes sayn,\nWhere as a man may have no audience,\nNought helpeth it to telle his sentence.\nAnd well I wot the substance is in me,\nIf anything shall well reported be.\nSir, say somewhat of hunting, <1> I you pray.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" quoth the Monk, \"I have *no lust to play;*       *no fondness for\nNow let another tell, as I have told.\"                          jesting*\nThen spake our Host with rude speech and bold,\nAnd said unto the Nunne's Priest anon,\n\"Come near, thou Priest, come hither, thou Sir John, <2>\nTell us such thing as may our heartes glade.*                   *gladden\nBe blithe, although thou ride upon a jade.\nWhat though thine horse be bothe foul and lean?\nIf he will serve thee, reck thou not a bean;\nLook that thine heart be merry evermo'.\"\n\n\"Yes, Host,\" quoth he, \"so may I ride or go,\nBut* I be merry, y-wis I will be blamed.\"                        *unless\nAnd right anon his tale he hath attamed*                  *commenced <3>\nAnd thus he said unto us every one,\nThis sweete priest, this goodly man, Sir John.\n\n\nNotes to the Prologue to the Nun's Priest's Tale\n\n\n1. The request is justified by the description of Monk in the\nPrologue as \"an out-rider, that loved venery.\"\n\n2. On this Tyrwhitt remarks; \"I know not how it has happened,\nthat in the principal modern languages, John, or its equivalent,\nis a name of contempt or at least of slight.  So the Italians use\n'Gianni,' from whence 'Zani;' the Spaniards 'Juan,' as 'Bobo\nJuan,' a foolish John; the French 'Jean,' with various additions;\nand in English, when we call a man 'a John,' we do not mean it\nas a title of honour.\"  The title of \"Sir\" was usually given by\ncourtesy to priests.\n\n3. Attamed: commenced, broached.

Amen.\n\n\nNotes to the Nun's Priest's Tale\n\n\n1.  The Tale of the Nun's Priest is founded on the fifth chapter\nof an old French metrical \"Romance of Renard;\" the same story\nforming one of the fables of Marie, the translator of the Breton\nLays. (See note 2 to the Prologue to the Franklin's Tale.)\nAlthough Dryden was in error when he ascribed the Tale to\nChaucer's own invention, still the materials on which he had to\noperate were out of cornparison more trivial than the result.\n\n2.  Tyrwhitt quotes two statutes of Edward III, in which \"deys\"\nare included among the servants employed in agricultural\npursuits; the name seems to have originally meant a servant who\ngave his labour by the day, but afterwards to have been\nappropriated exclusively to one who superintended or worked\nin a dairy.\n\n3. Orgon: here licentiously used for the plural, \"organs\" or\n\"orgons,\" corresponding to the plural verb \"gon\" in the next\nline.\n\n4. Horloge: French, \"clock.\"\n\n5. Embattell'd: indented on the upper edge like the battlements\nof a castle.\n\n6. My lefe is fare in land: This seems to have been the refrain of\nsome old song, and its precise meaning is uncertain. It\ncorresponds in cadence with the morning salutation of the cock;\nand may be taken as a greeting to the sun, which is beloved of\nChanticleer, and has just come upon the earth -- or in the sense\nof a more local boast, as vaunting the fairness of his favourite\nhen above all others in the country round.\n\nTranscriber's note: Later commentators explain \"fare in land\" as\n\"gone abroad\" and  have identified the song:\n\nMy lefe is fare in lond\nAlas! Why is she so?\nAnd I am so sore bound\nI may not come her to.\nShe hath my heart in hold\nWhere ever she ride or go\nWith true love a thousand-fold.\n\n(Printed in The Athenaeum, 1896, Vol II, p. 566).\n\n7. \"Avoi!\" is the word here rendered \"away!\" It was frequently\nused in the French fabliaux, and the Italians employ the word\n\"via!\" in the same sense.\n\n8. \"Ne do no force of dreams:\" \"Somnia ne cares;\" --  Cato\n\"De Moribus,\" 1 ii, dist. 32\n\n9. Centaury: the herb so called because by its virtue the centaur\nChiron was healed when the poisoned arrow of Hercules had\naccidentally wounded his foot.\n\n10. Fumetere: the herb \"fumitory.\"\n\n11. Catapuce:  spurge; a plant of purgative qualities. To its\nname in the text correspond the Italian \"catapuzza,\" and French\n\"catapuce\" -- words the origin of which is connected with the\neffects of the plant.\n\n12. Gaitre-berries: dog-wood berries.\n\n13. One of the greatest authors that men read: Cicero, who in\nhis book \"De Divinatione\" tells this and the following story,\nthough in contrary order and with many differences.\n\n14. Haled or hylled; from Anglo-Saxon \"helan\" hid, concealed\n\n15.  Kenelm succeeded his father as king of the Saxon realm of\nMercia in 811, at the age of seven years; but he was slain by his\nambitious aunt Quendrada. The place of his burial was\nmiraculously discovered, and he was subsequently elevated to\nthe rank of a saint and martyr. His life is in the English \"Golden\nLegend.\"\n\n16. Mercenrike: the kingdom of Mercia; Anglo-Saxon,\nMyrcnarice. Compare the second member of the compound in\nthe German, \"Frankreich,\" France; \"Oesterreich,\" Austria.\n\n17. Cicero (\"De Republica,\" lib. vi.) wrote the Dream of\nScipio, in which the Younger relates the appearance of the\nElder Africanus, and the counsels and exhortations which the\nshade addressed to the sleeper. Macrobius wrote an elaborate\n\"Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,\" -- a philosophical\ntreatise much studied and relished during the Middle Ages.\n\n18. See the Monk's Tale for this story.\n\n19. Andromache's dream will not be found in Homer; It is\nrelated in the book of the fictitious Dares Phrygius, the most\npopular authority during the Middle Ages for the history of the\nTrojan War.\n\n20. In principio: In the beginning; the first words of Genesis and\nof the Gospel of John.\n\n21. Mulier est hominis confusio:  This line is taken from the\nsame fabulous conference between the Emperor Adrian and the\nphilosopher Secundus, whence Chaucer derived some of the\narguments in praise of poverty employed in the Wife of Bath's\nTale proper. See note 14 to the Wife of Bath's tale.  The\npassage transferred to the text is the commencement of a\ndescription of woman. \"Quid est mulier? hominis confusio,\" &c.\n(\"What is Woman? A union with man\", &c.)\n\n22. Col-fox: a blackish fox, so called because of its likeness to\ncoal, according to Skinner; though more probably the prefix has\na reproachful meaning, and is in some way connected with the\nword \"cold\" as, some forty lines below, it is applied to the\nprejudicial counsel of women, and as frequently it is used to\ndescribe \"sighs\" and other tokens of grief, and \"cares\" or\n\"anxieties.\"\n\n23. Undern:  In this case, the meaning of \"evening\" or\n\"afternoon\" can hardly be applied to the word, which must be\ntaken to signify some early hour of the forenoon. See also note\n4 to the Wife of Bath's tale and note 5 to the Clerk's Tale.\n\n24. Ganilion: a traitor.  See note 9 to the Shipman's Tale and\nnote 28 to the Monk's Tale.\n\n25. Greek Sinon: The inventor of the Trojan Horse. See note 14\nto the Squire's Tale\n\n26. Boult it from the bren: Examine the matter thoroughly; a\nmetaphor taken from the sifting of meal, to divide the fine flour\nfrom the bran.\n\n27. Thomas Bradwardine, Archbishop of Canterbury in the\nthirteenth century, who wrote a book, \"De Causa Dei,\" in\ncontroversy with Pelagius; and also numerous other treatises,\namong them some  on predestination.\n\n28. In a popular mediaveal Latin treatise by one Theobaldus,\nentitled \"Physiologus de Naturis XII. Animalium\" (\"A\ndescription of the nature of twelve animals\"),  sirens or\nmermaids are described as skilled in song, and drawing unwary\nmariners to destruction by the sweetness of their voices.\n\n29. \"Nigellus Wireker,\" says Urry's Glossary, \"a monk and\nprecentor of Canterbury, wrote a Latin poem intituled\n'Speculum Speculorum,' ('The mirror of mirrors') dedicated to\nWilliam Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, and Lord Chancellor;\nwherein, under the fable of an Ass (which he calls 'Burnellus')\nthat desired a longer tail, is represented the folly of such as are\nnot content with their own condition. There is introduced a tale\nof a cock, who having his leg broke by a priest's son (called\nGundulfus) watched an opportunity to be revenged; which at\nlast presented itself on this occasion: A day was appointed for\nGundulfus's being admitted into holy orders at a place remote\nfrom his father's habitation; he therefore orders the servants to\ncall him at first cock-crowing, which the cock overhearing did\nnot crow at all that morning. So Gundulfus overslept himself,\nand was thereby disappointed of his ordination, the office being\nquite finished before he came to the place.\" Wireker's satire was\namong the most celebrated and popular Latin poems of the\nMiddle Ages. The Ass was probably as Tyrwhitt suggests,\ncalled \"Burnel\" or \"Brunel,\" from his brown colour; as, a little\nbelow, a reddish fox is called \"Russel.\"\n\n30. Flattour: flatterer; French, \"flatteur.\"\n\n31. Losengeour: deceiver, cozener; the word had analogues in\nthe French \"losengier,\" and the Spanish \"lisongero.\" It is\nprobably connected with \"leasing,\" falsehood; which has been\nderived from Anglo-Saxon \"hlisan,\" to celebrate -- as if it meant\nthe spreading of a false renown\n\n32. Dan Russel: Master Russet; a name given to the fox, from\nhis reddish colour.\n\n33. Geoffrey de Vinsauf was the author of a well-known\nmediaeval treatise on composition in various poetical styles of\nwhich he gave examples. Chaucer's irony is therefore directed\nagainst some grandiose and affected lines on the death of\nRichard I., intended to illustrate the pathetic style, in which\nFriday is addressed as \"O Veneris lachrymosa dies\" (\"O tearful\nday of Venus\").\n\n34. \"Priamum altaria ad ipsa trementem\n     Traxit, et in multo lapsantem sanguine nati\n     Implicuitque comam laeva, dextraque coruscum\n     Extulit, ac lateri capulo tenus abdidit ensem.\n     Haec finis Priami fatorum.\"\n(\"He dragged Priam trembling to his own altar, slipping on the\nblood of his child; He took his hair in his left hand, and with the\nright drew the flashing sword, and hid it to the hilt [in his body].\nThus an end was made of Priam\")\n-- Virgil, Aeneid. ii. 550.\n\n35. Jack Straw: The leader of a Kentish rising, in the reign of\nRichard II, in 1381, by which the Flemish merchants in London\nwere great sufferers.\n\n36.

The sixteen lines appended to the Tale of the Nun's Priest\nseem, as Tyrwhitt observes, to commence the prologue to the\nsucceeding Tale -- but the difficulty is to determine which that\nTale should be. In earlier editions, the lines formed the opening\nof the prologue to the Manciple's Tale; but most of the\nmanuscripts acknowledge themselves defective in this part, and\ngive the Nun's Tale after that of the Nun's Priest. In the Harleian\nmanuscript, followed by Mr Wright, the second Nun's Tale, and\nthe Canon's Yeoman's Tale, are placed after the Franklin's tale;\nand the sixteen lines above are not found -- the Manciple's\nprologue coming immediately after the \"Amen\" of the Nun's\nPriest. In two manuscripts, the last line of the sixteen runs thus:\n\"Said unto the Nun as ye shall hear;\" and six lines more\nevidently forged, are given to introduce the Nun's Tale.  All this\nconfusion and doubt only strengthen the certainty, and deepen\nthe regret, that \"The Canterbury Tales\" were left at Chaucer's,\ndeath not merely very imperfect as a whole, but destitute of\nmany finishing touches that would have made them complete so\nfar as the conception had actually been carried into\nperformance.\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND NUN'S TALE <1>\n\n\nThe minister and norice* unto vices,                              *nurse\nWhich that men call in English idleness,\nThe porter at the gate is of delices;*                         *delights\nT'eschew, and by her contrar' her oppress, --\nThat is to say, by lawful business,* --            *occupation, activity\nWell oughte we to *do our all intent*                  *apply ourselves*\nLest that the fiend through idleness us hent.*                    *seize\n\nFor he, that with his thousand cordes sly\nContinually us waiteth to beclap,*                       *entangle, bind\nWhen he may man in idleness espy,\nHe can so lightly catch him in his trap,\nTill that a man be hent* right by the lappe,**              *seize **hem\nHe is not ware the fiend hath him in hand;\nWell ought we work, and idleness withstand.\n\nAnd though men dreaded never for to die,\nYet see men well by reason, doubteless,\nThat idleness is root of sluggardy,\nOf which there cometh never good increase;\nAnd see that sloth them holdeth in a leas,*                   *leash <2>\nOnly to sleep, and for to eat and drink,\nAnd to devouren all that others swink.*                          *labour\n\nAnd, for to put us from such idleness,\nThat cause is of so great confusion,\nI have here done my faithful business,\nAfter the Legend, in translation\nRight of thy glorious life and passion, --\nThou with thy garland wrought of rose and lily,\nThee mean I, maid and martyr, Saint Cecilie.\n\nAnd thou, thou art the flow'r of virgins all,\nOf whom that Bernard list so well to write, <3>\nTo thee at my beginning first I call;\nThou comfort of us wretches, do me indite\nThy maiden's death, that won through her merite\nTh' eternal life, and o'er the fiend victory,\nAs man may after readen in her story.\n\nThou maid and mother, daughter of thy Son,\nThou well of mercy, sinful soules' cure,\nIn whom that God of bounte chose to won;*                         *dwell\nThou humble and high o'er every creature,\nThou nobilest, *so far forth our nature,*  *as far as our nature admits*\nThat no disdain the Maker had of kind,*                          *nature\nHis Son in blood and flesh to clothe and wind.*                    *wrap\n\nWithin the cloister of thy blissful sides\nTook manne's shape th' eternal love and peace,\nThat of *the trine compass* Lord and guide is              *the trinity*\nWhom earth, and sea, and heav'n, *out of release,*          *unceasingly\n*Aye hery;* and thou, Virgin wemmeless,*    *forever praise* *immaculate\nBare of thy body, and dweltest maiden pure,\nThe Creator of every creature.\n\nAssembled is in thee magnificence <4>\nWith mercy, goodness, and with such pity,\nThat thou, that art the sun of excellence,\nNot only helpest them that pray to thee,\nBut oftentime, of thy benignity,\nFull freely, ere that men thine help beseech,\nThou go'st before, and art their lives' leech.*        *healer, saviour.\n\nNow help, thou meek and blissful faire maid,\nMe, flemed* wretch, in this desert of gall;

This Tale was originally composed by Chaucer as a separate\nwork, and as such it is mentioned in the \"Legend of Good\nWomen\" under the title of \"The Life of Saint Cecile\".  Tyrwhitt\nquotes the line in which the author calls himself an \"unworthy\nson of Eve,\" and that in which he says, \"Yet pray I you, that\nreade what I write\", as internal evidence that the insertion of the\npoem in the Canterbury Tales was the result of an afterthought;\nwhile the whole tenor of the introduction confirms the belief\nthat Chaucer composed it as a writer or translator -- not,\ndramatically, as a speaker. The story is almost literally\ntranslated from the Life of St Cecilia in the \"Legenda Aurea.\"\n\n2. Leas: leash, snare; the same as \"las,\" oftener used by\nChaucer.\n\n3. The nativity and assumption of the Virgin Mary formed the\nthemes of some of St Bernard's most eloquent sermons.\n\n4. Compare with this stanza the fourth stanza of the Prioress's\nTale, the substance of which is the same.\n\n5. \"But he answered and said, it is not meet to take the\nchildren's bread, and cast it to dogs.  And she said, Truth, Lord:\nyet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's\ntable.\" --  Matthew xv. 26, 27.\n\n6.  See note 1.\n\n7. These are Latin puns: Heaven's lily - \"Coeli lilium\"; The way\nof blind - \"Caeci via\";  Heaven and Lia - from \"Coeli\", heaven,\nand \"Ligo,\" to bind; Heaven and Leos - from Coeli and \"Laos,\"\n(Ionian Greek) or \"Leos\" (Attic Greek), the people. Such\npunning derivations of proper names were very much in favour\nin the Middle Ages. The explanations of St Cecilia's name are\nliterally taken from the prologue to the Latin legend.\n\n8. This passage suggests Horace's description of the wise man,\nwho, among other things, is \"in se ipse totus, teres, atque\nrotundus.\" (\"complete in himself, polished and rounded\") --\nSatires, 2, vii. 80.\n\n9. Louting: lingering, or lying concealed; the Latin original has\n\"Inter sepulchra martyrum latiantem\" (\"hiding among the tombs\nof martyrs\")\n\n10.  The fourteen lines within brackets are supposed to have\nbeen originally an interpolation in the Latin legend, from which\nthey are literally translated. They awkwardly interrupt the flow\nof the narration.\n\n11. Engine: wit; the devising or constructive faculty; Latin,\n\"ingenium.\"\n\n12. Cold: wretched, distressful; see note 22 to the Nun's Priest's\nTale.\n\n13. Corniculere:  The secretary or registrar who was charged\nwith publishing the acts, decrees and orders of the prefect.\n\n14. \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I\nhave kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown\nof righteousness\" -- 2 Tim. iv. 7, 8.\n\n15. Did him to-beat:  Caused him to be cruelly or fatally beaten;\nthe force of the \"to\" is intensive.\n\n\n\nTHE CANON'S YEOMAN'S TALE. <1>\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\nWHEN ended was the life of Saint Cecile,\nEre we had ridden fully five mile, <2>\nAt Boughton-under-Blee us gan o'ertake\nA man, that clothed was in clothes black,\nAnd underneath he wore a white surplice.\nHis hackenay,* which was all pomely-gris,**           *nag **dapple-gray\nSo sweated, that it wonder was to see;\nIt seem'd as he had pricked* miles three.                       *spurred\nThe horse eke that his yeoman rode upon\nSo sweated, that unnethes* might he gon.**                  *hardly **go\nAbout the peytrel <3> stood the foam full high;\nHe was of foam, as *flecked as a pie.*           *spotted like a magpie*\nA maile twyfold <4> on his crupper lay;\nIt seemed that he carried little array;\nAll light for summer rode this worthy man.\nAnd in my heart to wonder I began\nWhat that he was, till that I understood\nHow that his cloak was sewed to his hood;\nFor which, when I had long advised* me,                      *considered\nI deemed him some Canon for to be.\nHis hat hung at his back down by a lace,*                          *cord\nFor he had ridden more than trot or pace;\nHe hadde pricked like as he were wood.*                             *mad\nA clote-leaf* he had laid  under his hood,                * burdock-leaf\nFor sweat, and for to keep his head from heat.\nBut it was joye for to see him sweat;\nHis forehead dropped as a stillatory*                             *still\nWere full of plantain or of paritory.*                       *wallflower\nAnd when that he was come, he gan to cry,\n\"God save,\" quoth he, \"this jolly company.\nFast have I pricked,\" quoth he, \"for your sake,\nBecause that I would you overtake,\nTo riden in this merry company.\"\nHis Yeoman was eke full of courtesy,\nAnd saide, \"Sirs, now in the morning tide\nOut of your hostelry I saw you ride,\nAnd warned here my lord and sovereign,\nWhich that to ride with you is full fain,\nFor his disport; he loveth dalliance.\"\n\"Friend, for thy warning God give thee good chance,\"*           *fortune\nSaid oure Host; \"certain it woulde seem\nThy lord were wise, and so I may well deem;\nHe is full jocund also, dare I lay;\nCan he aught tell a merry tale or tway,\nWith which he gladden may this company?\"\n\"Who, Sir? my lord?

It should seem that some sudden resentment\nhad determined Chaucer to interrupt the regular course of his\nwork, in order to insert a satire against the alchemists. That\ntheir pretended science was much cultivated about this time,\nand produced its usual evils, may fairly be inferred from the\nAct, which was passed soon after, 5 H. IV. c. iv., to make it\nfelony 'to multiply gold or silver, or to use the art of\nmultiplication.'\" Tyrwhitt finds in the prologue some colour\nfor the hypothesis that this Tale was intended by Chaucer to\nbegin the return journey from Canterbury; but against this\nmust be set the fact that the Yeoman himself expressly speaks\nof the distance to Canterbury yet to be ridden.\n\n2.

The Tale of the Canon's Yeoman, like those of the Wife of\nBath and the Pardoner, is made up of two parts; a long\ngeneral introduction, and the story proper. In the case of the\nWife of Bath, the interruptions of other pilgrims, and the\nautobiographical nature of the discourse, recommend the\nseparation of the prologue from the Tale proper; but in the\nother cases the introductory or merely connecting matter\nceases wholly where the opening of \"The Tale\" has been\nmarked in the text.\n\n2. Jupartie: Jeopardy, hazard.  In Froissart's French, \"a jeu\npartie\" is used to signify a game or contest in which the\nchances were exactly equal for both sides.\n\n3. Squames: Scales; Latin, \"squamae.\"\n\n4. Descensories: vessels for distillation \"per descensum;\" they\nwere placed under the fire, and the spirit to be extracted was\nthrown downwards.\nCroslets: crucibles; French, \"creuset.\".\nCucurbites: retorts; distilling-vessels; so called from their\nlikeness in shape to a gourd -- Latin, \"cucurbita.\"\nAlembikes:stills, limbecs.\n\n5. Seared pokettes: the meaning of this phrase is obscure; but\nif we take the reading \"cered poketts,\" from the Harleian\nmanuscript, we are led to the supposition that it signifies\nreceptacles -- bags or pokes -- prepared with wax for some\nprocess. Latin, \"cera,\" wax.\n\n6. Argoil: potter's clay, used for luting or closing vessels in\nthe laboratories of the alchemists; Latin, \"argilla;\" French,\n\"argile.\"\n\n7. Citrination: turning to a citrine colour, or yellow, by\nchemical action; that was the colour which proved the\nphilosopher's stone.\n\n8. Ingots: not, as in its modern meaning, the masses of metal\nshaped by pouring into moulds; but the moulds themslves into\nwhich the fused metal was poured. Compare Dutch,\n\"ingieten,\" part. \"inghehoten,\" to infuse; German,\n\"eingiessen,\" part. \"eingegossen,\" to pour in.\n\n9. Threpe: name; from Anglo-Saxon, \"threapian.\"\n\n10. Bratt:  coarse cloak; Anglo-Saxon, \"bratt.\" The word is\nstill used in Lincolnshire, and some parts of the north, to\nsignify a coarse kind of apron.\n\n11. Long on: in consequence of; the modern vulgar phrase \"all\nalong of,\" or \"all along on,\" best conveys the force of the\nwords in the text.\n\n12. Annualere: a priest employed in singing \"annuals\" or\nanniversary masses for the dead, without any cure of souls;\nthe office was such as, in the Prologue to the Tales, Chaucer\npraises the Parson for not seeking: Nor \"ran unto London,\nunto Saint Poul's, to seeke him a chantery for souls.\"\n\n13. Mortify:  a chemical phrase, signifying the dissolution of\nquicksilver in acid.\n\n14. Blin: cease; from Anglo-Saxon, \"blinnan,\" to desist.\n\n15. Name: took; from Anglo-Saxon, \"niman,\" to take.\nCompare German, \"nehmen,\" \"nahm.\"\n\n16. Los: praise, reputataion. See note 5 to Chaucer's tale of\nMeliboeus.\n\n17. Grame: sorrow; Anglo-Saxon, \"gram;\" German, \"Gram.\"\n\n18. Arnaldus Villanovanus, or Arnold de Villeneuve, was a\ndistinguished French chemist and physician of the fourteenth\ncentury; his \"Rosarium Philosophorum\" was a favourite text-book\nwith the alchemists of the generations that succeeded.\n\n19. Hermes Trismegistus, counsellor of Osiris, King of\nEgypt, was credited with the invention of writing and\nhieroglyphics, the drawing up of the laws of the Egyptians,\nand the origination of many sciences and arts. The\nAlexandrian school ascribed to him the mystic learning which\nit amplified; and the scholars of the Middle Ages regarded\nwith enthusiasm and reverence the works attributed to him --\nnotably a treatise on the philosopher's stone.\n\n20. Secret of secrets: \"Secreta Secretorum;\" a treatise, very\npopular in the Middle Ages, supposed to contain the sum of\nAristotle's instructions to Alexander. Lydgate translated about\nhalf of the work, when his labour was interrupted by his death\nabout 1460; and from the same treatise had been taken most\nof the seventh book of Gower's \"Confessio Amantis.\"\n\n21. Tyrwhitt says that this book was printed in the \"Theatrum\nChemicum,\" under the title, \"Senioris Zadith fi. Hamuelis\ntabula chymica\" (\"The chemical tables of Senior Zadith, son\nof Hamuel\"); and the story here told of Plato and his disciple\nwas there related of Solomon, but with some variations.\n\n22. Ignotum per ignotius: To explain the unknown by the\nmore unknown.\n\n23. Though he multiply term of his live: Though he pursue the\nalchemist's art all his days.\n\n\n\nTHE MANCIPLE'S TALE.\n\n\nTHE PROLOGUE.\n\n\nWEET* ye not where there stands a little town,                     *know\nWhich that y-called is Bob-up-and-down, <1>\nUnder the Blee, in Canterbury way?\nThere gan our Hoste for to jape and play,\nAnd saide, \"Sirs, what?

Bob-up-and-down: Mr Wright supposes this to be the village of\nHarbledown, near Canterbury, which  is situated on a hill, and near\nwhich there are many ups and downs in the road. Like Boughton,\nwhere the Canon and his Yeoman overtook the pilgrims, it stood on\nthe skirts of the Kentish forest of Blean or Blee.\n\n2. Dun is in the mire: a proverbial saying. \"Dun\" is a name for an\nass, derived from his colour.\n\n3. The mention of the Cook here, with no hint that he had already\ntold a story, confirms the indication given by the imperfect\ncondition of his Tale, that Chaucer intended to suppress the Tale\naltogether, and make him tell a story in some other place.\n\n4. The quintain; called \"fan\" or \"vane,\" because it turned round like\na weather-cock.\n\n5. Referring to the classification of wine, according to its effects on\na man, given in the old \"Calendrier des Bergiers,\" The man of\ncholeric temperament has \"wine of lion;\" the sanguine, \"wine of\nape;\" the phlegmatic, \"wine of sheep;\" the melancholic, \"wine of\nsow.\" There is a Rabbinical tradition that, when Noah was planting\nvines, Satan slaughtered beside them the four animals named; hence\nthe effect of wine in making those who drink it display in turn the\ncharacteristics of all the four.\n\n6. The pose:  a defluxion or rheum which stops the nose and\nobstructs the voice.\n\n7. Bring thee to his lure: A phrase in hawking -- to recall a hawk to\nthe fist; the meaning here is, that the Cook may one day bring the\nManciple to account, or pay him off, for the rebuke of his\ndrunkenness.\n\n\nTHE TALE. <1>\n\n\nWhen Phoebus dwelled here in earth adown,\nAs olde bookes make mentioun,\nHe was the moste lusty* bacheler                               *pleasant\nOf all this world, and eke* the best archer.                       *also\nHe slew Python the serpent, as he lay\nSleeping against the sun upon a day;\nAnd many another noble worthy deed\nHe with his bow wrought, as men maye read.\nPlayen he could on every minstrelsy,\nAnd singe, that it was a melody\nTo hearen of his cleare voice the soun'.\nCertes the king of Thebes, Amphioun,\nThat with his singing walled the city,\nCould never singe half so well as he.\nThereto he was the seemlieste man\nThat is, or was since that the world began;\nWhat needeth it his features to descrive?\nFor in this world is none so fair alive.\nHe was therewith full fill'd of gentleness,\nOf honour, and of perfect worthiness.\n\nThis Phoebus, that was flower of bach'lery,\nAs well in freedom* as in chivalry,                          *generosity\nFor his disport, in sign eke of victory\nOf Python, so as telleth us the story,\nWas wont to bearen in his hand a bow.\nNow had this Phoebus in his house a crow,\nWhich in a cage he foster'd many a day,\nAnd taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.\nWhite was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,\nAnd counterfeit the speech of every man\nHe coulde, when he shoulde tell a tale.\nTherewith in all this world no nightingale\nNe coulde by an hundred thousand deal*                             *part\nSinge so wondrous merrily and well.\nNow had this Phoebus in his house a wife;\nWhich that he loved more than his life.\nAnd night and day did ever his diligence\nHer for to please, and do her reverence:\nSave only, if that I the sooth shall sayn,\nJealous he was, and would have kept her fain.\nFor him were loth y-japed* for to be;

Rom, ram, ruf: a contemptuous reference to the alliterative\npoetry which was at that time very popular, in preference even,\nit would seem, to rhyme, in the northern parts of the country,\nwhere the language was much more barbarous and unpolished\nthan in the south.\n\n2. Perfect glorious pilgrimage:  the word is used here to signify\nthe shrine, or destination, to which pilgrimage is made.\n\n\nTHE TALE. <1>\n\n\n[The Parson begins his \"little treatise\" -(which, if given at\nlength, would extend to about thirty of these pages, and which\ncannot by any stretch of courtesy or fancy be said to merit the\ntitle of a \"Tale\") in these words: --]\n\nOur sweet Lord God of Heaven, that no man will perish, but\nwill that we come all to the knowledge of him, and to the\nblissful life that is perdurable [everlasting], admonishes us by\nthe prophet Jeremiah, that saith in this wise: \"Stand upon the\nways, and see and ask of old paths, that is to say, of old\nsentences, which is the good way, and walk in that way, and ye\nshall find refreshing for your souls,\" <2> &c.  Many be the\nspiritual ways that lead folk to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the\nreign of glory; of which ways there is a full noble way, and full\nconvenable, which may not fail to man nor to woman, that\nthrough sin hath misgone from the right way of Jerusalem\ncelestial; and this way is called penitence. Of which men should\ngladly hearken and inquire with all their hearts, to wit what is\npenitence, and whence it is called penitence, and in what\nmanner, and in how many manners, be the actions or workings\nof penitence, and how many species there be of penitences, and\nwhat things appertain and behove to penitence, and what things\ndisturb penitence.\n\n[Penitence is described, on the authority of Saints Ambrose,\nIsidore, and Gregory, as the bewailing of sin that has been\nwrought, with the purpose never again to do that thing, or any\nother thing which a man should bewail; for weeping and not\nceasing to do the sin will not avail -- though it is to be hoped\nthat after every time that a man falls, be it ever so often, he may\nfind grace to arise through penitence. And repentant folk that\nleave their sin ere sin leave them, are accounted by Holy Church\nsure of their salvation, even though the repentance be at the last\nhour. There are three actions of penitence; that a man be\nbaptized after he has sinned; that he do no deadly sin after\nreceiving baptism; and that he fall into no venial sins from day\nto day. \"Thereof saith St Augustine, that penitence of good and\nhumble folk is the penitence of every day.\" The species of\npenitence are three: solemn, when a man is openly expelled\nfrom Holy Church in Lent, or is compelled by Holy Church to\ndo open penance for an open sin openly talked of in the\ncountry; common penance, enjoined by priests in certain cases,\nas to go on pilgrimage naked or barefoot; and privy penance,\nwhich men do daily for private sins, of which they confess\nprivately and receive private penance. To very perfect penitence\nare behoveful and necessary three things: contrition of heart,\nconfession of mouth, and satisfaction; which are fruitful\npenitence against delight in thinking, reckless speech, and\nwicked sinful works.\n\nPenitence may be likened to a tree, having its root in contrition,\nbiding itself in the heart as a tree-root does in the earth; out of\nthis root springs a stalk, that bears branches and leaves of\nconfession, and fruit of satisfaction. Of this root also springs a\nseed of grace, which is mother of all security, and this seed is\neager and hot; and the grace of this seed springs of God,\nthrough remembrance on the day of judgment and on the pains\nof hell. The heat of this seed is the love of God, and the desire\nof everlasting joy; and this heat draws the heart of man to God,\nand makes him hate his sin. Penance is the tree of life to them\nthat receive it. In penance or contrition man shall understand\nfour things: what is contrition; what are the causes that move a\nman to contrition; how he should be contrite; and what\ncontrition availeth to the soul. Contrition is the heavy and\ngrievous sorrow that a man receiveth in his heart for his sins,\nwith earnest purpose to confess and do penance, and never\nmore to sin. Six causes ought to move a man to contrition: 1.\nHe should remember him of his sins; 2. He should reflect that\nsin putteth a man in great thraldom, and all the greater the\nhigher is the estate from which he falls; 3. He should dread the\nday of doom and the horrible pains of hell; 4. The sorrowful\nremembrance of the good deeds that  man hath omitted to do\nhere on earth, and also the good that he hath lost, ought to\nmake him have contrition; 5. So also ought the remembrance of\nthe passion that our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for our sins; 6.\nAnd so ought the hope of three things, that is to say,\nforgiveness of sin, the gift of grace to do well, and the glory of\nheaven with which God shall reward man for his good deeds. --\nAll these points the Parson illustrates and enforces at length;\nwaxing especially eloquent under the third head, and plainly\nsetting forth the sternly realistic notions regarding future\npunishments that were entertained in the time of Chaucer:-] <3>\n\nCertes, all the sorrow that a man might make from the\nbeginning of the world, is but a little thing, at <DW44> of [in\ncomparison with] the sorrow of hell. The cause why that Job\ncalleth hell the land of darkness; <4> understand, that he calleth\nit land or earth, for it is stable and never shall fail, and dark, for\nhe that is in hell hath default [is devoid] of light natural; for\ncertes the dark light, that shall come out of the fire that ever\nshall burn, shall turn them all to pain that be in hell, for it\nsheweth them the horrible devils that them torment. Covered\nwith the darkness of death; that is to say, that he that is in hell\nshall have default of the sight of God; for certes the sight of\nGod is the life perdurable [everlasting]. The darkness of death,\nbe the sins that the wretched man hath done, which that disturb\n[prevent] him to see the face of God, right as a dark cloud doth\nbetween us and the sun. Land of misease, because there be three\nmanner of defaults against three things that folk of this world\nhave in this present life; that is to say, honours, delights, and\nriches. Against honour have they in hell shame and confusion:\nfor well ye wot, that men call honour the reverence that man\ndoth to man; but in hell is no honour nor reverence; for certes\nno more reverence shall be done there to a king than to a knave\n[servant]. For which God saith by the prophet Jeremiah; \"The\nfolk that me despise shall be in despite.\" Honour is also called\ngreat lordship. There shall no wight serve other, but of harm\nand torment. Honour is also called great dignity and highness;\nbut in hell shall they be all fortrodden [trampled under foot] of\ndevils. As God saith, \"The horrible devils shall go and come\nupon the heads of damned folk;\" and this is, forasmuch as the\nhigher that they were in this present life, the more shall they be\nabated [abased] and defouled in hell. Against the riches of this\nworld shall they have misease [trouble, torment] of poverty, and\nthis poverty shall be in four things: in default [want] of treasure;\nof which David saith, \"The rich folk that embraced and oned\n[united] all their heart to treasure of this world, shall sleep in the\nsleeping of death, and nothing shall they find in their hands of\nall their treasure.\" And moreover, the misease of hell shall be in\ndefault of meat and drink. For God saith thus by Moses, \"They\nshall be wasted with hunger, and the birds of hell shall devour\nthem with bitter death, and the gall of the dragon shall be their\ndrink, and the venom of the dragon their morsels.\" And\nfurthermore, their misease shall be in default of clothing, for\nthey shall be naked in body, as of clothing, save the fire in\nwhich they burn, and other filths; and naked shall they be in\nsoul, of all manner virtues, which that is the clothing of the soul.\nWhere be then the gay robes, and the soft sheets, and the fine\nshirts? Lo, what saith of them the prophet Isaiah, that under\nthem shall be strewed moths, and their covertures shall be of\nworms of hell. And furthermore, their misease shall be in default\nof friends, for he is not poor that hath good friends: but there is\nno friend; for neither God nor any good creature shall be friend\nto them, and evereach of them shall hate other with deadly hate.\nThe Sons and the daughters shall rebel against father and\nmother, and kindred against kindred, and chide and despise each\nother, both day and night, as God saith by the prophet Micah.\nAnd the loving children, that whom loved so fleshly each other,\nwould each of them eat the other if they might. For how should\nthey love together in the pains of hell, when they hated each\nother in the prosperity of this life? For trust well, their fleshly\nlove was deadly hate; as saith the prophet David; \"Whoso\nloveth wickedness, he hateth his own soul:\" and whoso hateth\nhis own soul, certes he may love none other wight in no\nmanner: and therefore in hell is no solace nor no friendship, but\never the more kindreds that be in hell, the more cursing, the\nmore chiding, and the more deadly hate there is among them.\nAnd furtherover, they shall have default of all manner delights;\nfor certes delights be after the appetites of the five wits\n[senses]; as sight, hearing, smelling, savouring [tasting], and\ntouching. But in hell their sight shall be full of darkness and of\nsmoke, and their eyes full of tears; and their hearing full of\nwaimenting [lamenting] and grinting [gnashing] of teeth, as\nsaith Jesus Christ; their nostrils shall be full of stinking; and, as\nsaith Isaiah the prophet, their savouring  [tasting] shall be full of\nbitter gall; and touching of all their body shall be covered with\nfire that never shall quench, and with worms that never shall\ndie, as God saith by the mouth of Isaiah. And forasmuch as they\nshall not ween that they may die for pain, and by death flee from\npain, that may they understand in the word of Job, that saith,\n\"There is the shadow of death.\" Certes a shadow hath the\nlikeness of the thing of which it is shadowed, but the shadow is\nnot the same thing of which it is shadowed: right so fareth the\npain of hell; it is like death, for the horrible anguish; and why?\nfor it paineth them ever as though they should die anon; but\ncertes they shall not die. For, as saith Saint Gregory, \"To\nwretched caitiffs shall be given death without death, and end\nwithout end, and default without failing; for their death shall\nalways live, and their end shall evermore begin, and their default\nshall never fail.\" And therefore saith Saint John the Evangelist,\n\"They shall follow death, and they shall not find him, and they\nshall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.\" And eke Job\nsaith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath\ncreated all things in right order, and nothing without order, but\nall things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that\nbe damned be not in order, nor hold no order. For the earth\nshall bear them no fruit (for, as the prophet David saith, \"God\nshall destroy the fruit of the earth, as for them\"); nor water shall\ngive them no moisture, nor the air no refreshing, nor the fire no\nlight. For as saith Saint Basil, \"The burning of  the fire of this\nworld shall God give in hell to them that be damned, but the\nlight and the clearness shall be given in heaven to his children;\nright as the good man giveth flesh to his children, and bones to\nhis hounds.\" And for they shall have no hope to escape, saith\nJob at last, that there shall horror and grisly dread dwell without\nend. Horror is always dread of harm that is to come, and this\ndread shall ever dwell in the hearts of them that be damned.\nAnd therefore have they lost all their hope for seven causes.\nFirst, for God that is their judge shall be without mercy to them;\nnor they may not please him; nor none of his hallows [saints];\nnor they may give nothing for their ransom; nor they have no\nvoice to speak to him; nor they may not flee from pain; nor they\nhave no goodness in them that they may shew to deliver them\nfrom pain.\n\n[Under the fourth head, of good works, the Parson says: --]\n\nThe courteous Lord Jesus Christ will that no good work be lost,\nfor in somewhat it shall avail. But forasmuch as the good works\nthat men do while they be in good life be all amortised [killed,\ndeadened] by sin following, and also since all the good works\nthat men do while they be in deadly sin be utterly dead, as for to\nhave the life perdurable [everlasting], well may that man that no\ngood works doth, sing that new French song, J'ai tout perdu --\nmon temps et mon labour <5>. For certes, sin bereaveth a man\nboth the goodness of nature, and eke the goodness of grace.\nFor soothly the grace of the Holy Ghost fareth like fire, that\nmay not be idle; for fire faileth anon as it forleteth [leaveth] its\nworking, and right so grace faileth anon as it forleteth its\nworking. Then loseth the sinful man the goodness of glory, that\nonly is to good men that labour and work. Well may he be sorry\nthen, that oweth all his life to God, as long as he hath lived, and\nalso as long as he shall live, that no goodness hath to pay with\nhis debt to God, to whom he oweth all his life: for trust well he\nshall give account, as saith Saint Bernard, of all the goods that\nhave been given him in his present life, and how he hath them\ndispended, insomuch that there shall not perish an hair of his\nhead, nor a moment of an hour shall not perish of his time, that\nhe shall not give thereof a reckoning.\n\n[Having treated of the causes, the Parson comes to the manner,\nof contrition -- which should be universal and total, not merely\nof outward deeds of sin, but also of wicked delights and\nthoughts and words; \"for certes Almighty God is all good, and\ntherefore either he forgiveth all, or else right naught.\" Further,\ncontrition should be \"wonder sorrowful and anguishous,\" and\nalso continual, with steadfast purpose of confession and\namendment. Lastly, of what contrition availeth, the Parson says,\nthat sometimes it delivereth man from sin; that without it neither\nconfession nor satisfaction is of any worth; that it \"destroyeth\nthe prison of hell, and maketh weak and feeble all the strengths\nof the devils, and restoreth the gifts of the Holy Ghost and of all\ngood virtues, and cleanseth the soul of sin, and delivereth it\nfrom the pain of hell, and from the company of the devil, and\nfrom the servage [slavery] of sin, and restoreth it to all goods\nspiritual, and to the company and communion of Holy Church.\"\nHe who should set his intent to these things, would no longer be\ninclined to sin, but would give his heart and body to the service\nof Jesus Christ, and thereof do him homage. \"For, certes, our\nLord Jesus Christ hath spared us so benignly in our follies, that\nif he had not pity on man's soul, a sorry song might we all sing.\"\n\nThe Second Part of the Parson's Tale or Treatise opens with an\nexplanation of what is confession -- which is termed \"the\nsecond part of penitence, that is, sign of contrition;\" whether it\nought needs be done or not; and what things be convenable to\ntrue confession. Confession is true shewing of sins to the priest,\nwithout excusing, hiding, or forwrapping [disguising] of\nanything, and without vaunting of good works. \"Also, it is\nnecessary to understand whence that sins spring, and how they\nincrease, and which they be.\" From Adam we took original sin;\n\"from him fleshly descended be we all, and engendered of vile\nand corrupt matter;\" and the penalty of Adam's transgression\ndwelleth with us as to temptation, which penalty is called\nconcupiscence. \"This concupiscence, when it is wrongfully\ndisposed or ordained in a man, it maketh him covet, by covetise\nof flesh, fleshly sin by sight of his eyes, as to earthly things, and\nalso covetise of highness by pride of heart.\" The Parson\nproceeds to shew how man is tempted in his flesh to sin; how,\nafter his natural concupiscence, comes suggestion of the devil,\nthat is to say the devil's bellows, with which he bloweth in man\nthe fire of con cupiscence; and how man then bethinketh him\nwhether he will do or no the thing to which he is tempted. If he\nflame up into pleasure at the thought, and give way, then is he\nall dead in soul; \"and thus is sin accomplished, by temptation, by\ndelight, and by consenting; and then is the sin actual.\" Sin is\neither venial, or deadly; deadly, when a man loves any creature\nmore than Jesus Christ our Creator, venial, if he love Jesus\nChrist less than he ought. Venial sins diminish man's love to\nGod more and more, and may in this wise skip into deadly sin;\nfor many small make a great. \"And hearken this example: A\ngreat wave of the sea cometh sometimes with so great a\nviolence, that it drencheth [causes to sink] the ship: and the\nsame harm do sometimes the small drops, of water that enter\nthrough a little crevice in the thurrok [hold, bilge], and in the\nbottom of the ship, if men be so negligent that they discharge\nthem not betimes. And therefore, although there be difference\nbetwixt these two causes of drenching, algates [in any case] the\nship is dreint [sunk]. Right so fareth it sometimes of deadly sin,\"\nand of venial sins when they multiply in a man so greatly as to\nmake him love worldly things more than God. The Parson then\nenumerates specially a number of sins which many a man\nperadventure deems no sins, and confesses them not, and yet\nnevertheless they are truly sins: -- ]\n\nThis is to say, at every time that a man eateth and drinketh more\nthan sufficeth to the sustenance of his body, in certain he doth\nsin; eke when he speaketh more than it needeth, he doth sin; eke\nwhen he heareth not benignly the complaint of the poor; eke\nwhen he is in health of body, and will not fast when other folk\nfast, without cause reasonable; eke when he sleepeth more than\nneedeth, or when he cometh by that occasion too late to church,\nor to other works of charity; eke when he useth his wife without\nsovereign desire of engendrure, to the honour of God, or for the\nintent to yield his wife his debt of his body; eke when he will not\nvisit the sick, or the prisoner, if he may; eke if he love wife, or\nchild, or other worldly thing, more than reason requireth; eke if\nhe flatter or blandish more than he ought for any necessity; eke\nif he minish or withdraw the alms of the poor; eke if he apparail\n[prepare] his meat more deliciously than need is, or eat it too\nhastily by likerousness [gluttony];  eke if he talk vanities in the\nchurch, or at God's service, or that he be a talker of idle words\nof folly or villainy, for he shall yield account of them at the day\nof doom; eke when he behighteth [promiseth] or assureth to do\nthings that he may not perform; eke when that by lightness of\nfolly he missayeth or scorneth his neighbour; eke when he hath\nany wicked suspicion of thing, that he wot of it no\nsoothfastness: these things, and more without number, be sins,\nas saith Saint Augustine.\n\n[No earthly man may eschew all venial sins; yet may he refrain\nhim, by the burning love that he hath to our Lord Jesus Christ,\nand by prayer and confession, and other good works, so that it\nshall but little grieve. \"Furthermore, men may also refrain and\nput away venial sin, by receiving worthily the precious body of\nJesus Christ; by receiving eke of holy water; by alms-deed; by\ngeneral confession of Confiteor at mass, and at prime, and at\ncompline [evening service]; and by blessing of bishops and\npriests, and by other good works.\" The Parson then proceeds to\nweightier matters:-- ]\n\nNow it is behovely [profitable, necessary] to tell which be\ndeadly sins, that is to say, chieftains of sins; forasmuch as all\nthey run in one leash, but in diverse manners. Now be they\ncalled chieftains, forasmuch as they be chief, and of them spring\nall other sins. The root of these sins, then, is pride, the general\nroot of all harms. For of this root spring certain branches: as ire,\nenvy, accidie <6> or sloth, avarice or covetousness (to common\nunderstanding), gluttony, and lechery: and each of these sins\nhath his branches and his twigs, as shall be declared in their\nchapters following. And though so be, that no man can tell\nutterly the number of the twigs, and of the harms that come of\npride, yet will I shew a part of them, as ye shall understand.\nThere is inobedience, vaunting, hypocrisy, despite, arrogance,\nimpudence, swelling of hearte, insolence, elation, impatience,\nstrife, contumacy, presumption, irreverence, pertinacity, vain-\nglory and many another twig that I cannot tell nor declare. . . .]\n\nAnd yet [moreover] there is a privy species of pride that waiteth\nfirst to be saluted ere he will salute, all [although] be he less\nworthy than that other is; and eke he waiteth [expecteth] or\ndesireth to sit or to go above him in the way, or kiss the pax,\n<7> or be incensed, or go to offering before his neighbour, and\nsuch semblable [like] things, against his duty peradventure, but\nthat he hath his heart and his intent in such a proud desire to be\nmagnified and honoured before the people. Now be there two\nmanner of prides; the one of them is within the heart of a man,\nand the other is without. Of which soothly these foresaid things,\nand more than I have said, appertain to pride that is within the\nheart of a man and there be other species of pride that be\nwithout: but nevertheless, the one of these species of pride is\nsign of the other, right as the gay levesell [bush] at the tavern is\nsign of the wine that is in the cellar. And this is in many things:\nas in speech and countenance, and outrageous array of clothing;\nfor certes, if there had been no sin in clothing, Christ would not\nso soon have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man\nin the gospel. And Saint Gregory saith, that precious clothing is\nculpable for the dearth [dearness] of it, and for its softness, and\nfor its strangeness and disguising, and for the superfluity or for\nthe inordinate scantness of it; alas! may not a man see in our\ndays the sinful costly array of clothing, and namely [specially] in\ntoo much superfluity, or else in too disordinate scantness? As to\nthe first sin, in superfluity of clothing, which that maketh it so\ndear, to the harm of the people, not only the cost of the\nembroidering, the disguising, indenting or barring, ounding,\npaling, <8> winding, or banding, and semblable [similar] waste\nof cloth in vanity; but there is also the costly furring [lining or\nedging with fur] in their gowns, so much punching of chisels to\nmake holes, so much dagging [cutting] of shears, with the\nsuperfluity in length of the foresaid gowns, trailing in the dung\nand in the mire, on horse and eke on foot, as well of man as of\nwoman, that all that trailing is verily (as in effect) wasted,\nconsumed, threadbare, and rotten with dung, rather than it is\ngiven to the poor, to great damage of the foresaid poor folk,\nand that in sundry wise: this is to say, the more that cloth is\nwasted, the more must it cost to the poor people for the\nscarceness; and furthermore, if so be that they would give such\npunched and dagged clothing to the poor people, it is not\nconvenient to wear for their estate, nor sufficient to boot [help,\nremedy] their necessity, to keep them from the distemperance\n[inclemency] of the firmament. Upon the other side, to speak of\nthe horrible disordinate scantness of clothing, as be these cutted\nslops or hanselines [breeches] , that through their shortness\ncover not the shameful member of man, to wicked intent alas!\nsome of them shew the boss and the shape of the horrible\nswollen members, that seem like to the malady of hernia, in the\nwrapping of their hosen, and eke the buttocks of them, that fare\nas it were the hinder part of a she-ape in the full of the moon.\nAnd more over the wretched swollen members that they shew\nthrough disguising, in departing [dividing] of their hosen in\nwhite and red, seemeth that half their shameful privy members\nwere flain [flayed]. And if so be that they depart their hosen in\nother colours, as is white and blue, or white and black, or black\nand red, and so forth; then seemeth it, by variance of colour,\nthat the half part of their privy members be corrupt by the fire\nof Saint Anthony, or by canker, or other such mischance. And\nof the hinder part of their buttocks it is full horrible to see, for\ncertes, in that part of their body where they purge their stinking\nordure, that foul part shew they to the people proudly in despite\nof honesty [decency], which honesty Jesus Christ and his friends\nobserved to shew in his life. Now as of the outrageous array of\nwomen, God wot, that though the visages of some of them\nseem full chaste and debonair [gentle], yet notify they, in their\narray of attire, likerousness and pride. I say not that honesty\n[reasonable and appropriate style] in clothing of man or woman\nunconvenable but, certes, the superfluity or disordinate scarcity\nof clothing is reprovable. Also the sin of their ornament, or of\napparel, as in things that appertain to riding, as in too many\ndelicate horses, that be holden for delight, that be so fair, fat,\nand costly; and also in many a vicious knave, [servant] that is\nsustained because of them; in curious harness, as in saddles,\ncruppers, peytrels, [breast-plates] and bridles, covered with\nprecious cloth and rich bars and plates of gold and silver. For\nwhich God saith by Zechariah the prophet, \"I will confound the\nriders of such horses.\" These folk take little regard of the riding\nof God's Son of heaven, and of his harness, when he rode upon\nan ass, and had no other harness but the poor clothes of his\ndisciples; nor we read not that ever he rode on any other beast.\nI speak this for the sin of superfluity, and not for reasonable\nhonesty [seemliness], when reason it requireth. And moreover,\ncertes, pride is greatly notified in holding of great meinie\n[retinue of servants], when they be of little profit or of right no\nprofit, and namely [especially] when that meinie is felonous\n[violent ] and damageous [harmful] to the people by hardiness\n[arrogance] of high lordship, or by way of office; for certes,\nsuch lords sell then their lordship to the devil of hell, when they\nsustain the wickedness of their meinie. Or else, when these folk\nof low degree, as they that hold hostelries, sustain theft of their\nhostellers, and that is in many manner of deceits: that manner of\nfolk be the flies that follow the honey, or else the hounds that\nfollow the carrion. Such foresaid folk strangle spiritually their\nlordships; for which thus saith David the prophet, \"Wicked\ndeath may come unto these lordships, and God give that they\nmay descend into hell adown; for in their houses is iniquity and\nshrewedness, [impiety] and not God of heaven.\" And certes, but\nif [unless] they do amendment, right as God gave his benison\n[blessing] to Laban by the service of Jacob, and to Pharaoh by\nthe service of Joseph; right so God will give his malison\n[condemnation] to such lordships as sustain the wickedness of\ntheir servants, but [unless] they come to amendment. Pride of\nthe table apaireth [worketh harm] eke full oft; for, certes, rich\nmen be called to feasts, and poor folk be put away and rebuked;\nalso in excess of divers meats and drinks, and namely [specially]\nsuch manner bake-meats and dish-meats burning of wild fire,\nand painted and castled with paper, and semblable [similar]\nwaste, so that it is abuse to think. And eke in too great\npreciousness of vessel, [plate] and curiosity of minstrelsy, by\nwhich a man is stirred more to the delights of luxury, if so be\nthat he set his heart the less upon our Lord Jesus Christ, certain\nit is a sin; and certainly the delights might be so great in this\ncase, that a man might lightly [easily] fall by them into deadly\nsin.\n\n[The sins that arise of pride advisedly and habitually are deadly;\nthose that arise by frailty unadvised suddenly, and suddenly\nwithdraw again, though grievous, are not deadly. Pride itself\nsprings sometimes of the goods of nature, sometimes of the\ngoods of fortune, sometimes of the goods of grace; but the\nParson, enumerating and examining all these in turn, points out\nhow little security they possess and how little ground for pride\nthey furnish, and goes on to enforce the remedy against pride --\nwhich is humility or meekness, a virtue through which a man\nhath true knowledge of himself, and holdeth no high esteem of\nhimself in regard of his deserts, considering ever his frailty.]\n\nNow be there three manners [kinds] of humility; as humility in\nheart, and another in the mouth, and the third in works. The\nhumility in the heart is in four manners: the one is, when a man\nholdeth himself as nought worth before God of heaven; the\nsecond is, when he despiseth no other man; the third is, when he\nrecketh not though men hold him nought worth; the fourth is,\nwhen he is not sorry of his humiliation. Also the humility of\nmouth is in four things: in temperate speech; in humility of\nspeech; and when he confesseth with his own mouth that he is\nsuch as he thinketh that he is in his heart; another is, when he\npraiseth the bounte [goodness] of another man and nothing\nthereof diminisheth. Humility eke in works is in four manners:\nthe first is, when he putteth other men before him; the second is,\nto choose the lowest place of all; the third is, gladly to assent to\ngood counsel; the fourth is, to stand gladly by the award\n[judgment] of his sovereign, or of him that is higher in degree:\ncertain this is a great work of humility.\n\n[The Parson proceeds to treat of the other cardinal sins, and\ntheir remedies: (2.) Envy, with its remedy, the love of God\nprincipally and of our neighbours as ourselves: (3.) Anger, with\nall its fruits in revenge, rancour, hate, discord, manslaughter,\nblasphemy, swearing, falsehood, flattery, chiding and reproving,\nscorning, treachery, sowing of strife, doubleness of tongue,\nbetraying of counsel to a man's disgrace, menacing, idle words,\njangling, japery or buffoonery, &c. -- and its remedy in the\nvirtues called mansuetude, debonairte, or gentleness, and\npatience or sufferance: (4.) Sloth, or \"Accidie,\" which comes\nafter the sin of Anger, because Envy blinds the eyes of a man,\nand Anger troubleth a man, and Sloth maketh him heavy,\nthoughtful, and peevish. It is opposed to every estate of man --\nas unfallen, and held to work in praising and adoring God; as\nsinful, and held to labour in praying for deliverance from sin;\nand as in the state of grace, and held to works of penitence. It\nresembles the heavy and sluggish condition of those in hell; it\nwill suffer no hardness and no penance; it prevents any\nbeginning of good works; it causes despair of God's mercy,\nwhich is the sin against the Holy Ghost; it induces somnolency\nand neglect of communion in prayer with God; and it breeds\nnegligence or recklessness, that cares for nothing, and is the\nnurse of all mischiefs, if ignorance is their mother. Against\nSloth, and these and other branches and fruits of it, the remedy\nlies in the virtue of fortitude or strength, in its various species of\nmagnanimity or great courage; faith and hope in God and his\nsaints; surety or sickerness, when a man fears nothing that can\noppose the good works he has under taken; magnificence, when\nhe carries out great works of goodness begun; constancy or\nstableness of heart; and other incentives to energy and laborious\nservice: (5.) Avarice, or Covetousness, which is the root of all\nharms, since its votaries are idolaters, oppressors and enslavers\nof men, deceivers of their equals in business, simoniacs,\ngamblers, liars, thieves, false swearers, blasphemers, murderers,\nand sacrilegious. Its remedy lies in compassion and pity largely\nexercised, and in reasonable liberality -- for those who spend on\n\"fool-largesse,\" or ostentation of worldly estate and luxury,\nshall receive the malison [condemnation] that Christ shall give\nat the day of doom to them that shall be damned: (6.) Gluttony;\n-- of which the Parson treats so briefly that the chapter may be\ngiven in full: -- ]\n\nAfter Avarice cometh Gluttony, which is express against the\ncommandment of God. Gluttony is unmeasurable appetite to eat\nor to drink; or else to do in aught to the unmeasurable appetite\nand disordered covetousness [craving] to eat or drink. This sin\ncorrupted all this world, as is well shewed in the sin of Adam\nand of Eve. Look also what saith Saint Paul of gluttony:\n\"Many,\" saith he, \"go, of which I have oft said to you, and now\nI say it weeping, that they be enemies of the cross of Christ, of\nwhich the end is death, and of which their womb [stomach] is\ntheir God and their glory;\" in confusion of them that so savour\n[take delight in] earthly things. He that is usant [accustomed,\naddicted] to this sin of gluttony, he may no sin withstand, he\nmust be in servage [bondage] of all vices,  for it is the devil's\nhoard, [lair, lurking-place] where he hideth him in and resteth.\nThis sin hath many species. The first is drunkenness, that is the\nhorrible sepulture of man's reason: and therefore when a man is\ndrunken, he hath lost his reason; and this is deadly sin. But\nsoothly, when that a man is not wont to strong drink, and\nperadventure knoweth not the strength of the drink, or hath\nfeebleness in his head, or hath travailed [laboured], through\nwhich he drinketh the more, all [although] be he suddenly\ncaught with drink, it is no deadly sin, but venial. The second\nspecies of gluttony is, that the spirit of a man waxeth all\ntroubled for drunkenness, and bereaveth a man the discretion of\nhis wit. The third species of gluttony is, when a man devoureth\nhis meat, and hath no rightful manner of eating. The fourth is,\nwhen, through the great abundance of his meat, the humours of\nhis body be distempered. The fifth is, forgetfulness by too much\ndrinking, for which a man sometimes forgetteth by the morrow\nwhat be did at eve. In other manner be distinct the species of\ngluttony, after Saint Gregory. The first is, for to eat or drink\nbefore time. The second is, when a man getteth him too delicate\nmeat or drink. The third is, when men take too much over\nmeasure [immoderately]. The fourth is curiosity [nicety] with\ngreat intent [application, pains] to make and apparel [prepare]\nhis meat. The fifth is, for to eat too greedily. These be the five\nfingers of the devil's hand, by which he draweth folk to the sin.\n\nAgainst gluttony the remedy is abstinence, as saith Galen; but\nthat I hold not meritorious, if he do it only for the health of his\nbody. Saint Augustine will that abstinence be done for virtue,\nand with patience. Abstinence, saith he, is little worth, but  if\n[unless] a man have good will thereto, and but it be enforced by\npatience and by charity, and that men do it for God's sake, and\nin hope to have the bliss in heaven. The fellows of abstinence be\ntemperance, that holdeth the mean in all things; also shame, that\nescheweth all dishonesty [indecency, impropriety], sufficiency,\nthat seeketh no rich meats nor drinks, nor doth no force of [sets\nno value on] no outrageous apparelling of meat; measure\n[moderation] also, that restraineth by reason the unmeasurable\nappetite of eating; soberness also, that restraineth the outrage of\ndrink; sparing also, that restraineth the delicate ease to sit long\nat meat, wherefore some folk stand of their own will to eat,\nbecause they will eat at less leisure.\n\n[At great length the Parson then points out the many varieties of\nthe sin of (7.) Lechery, and its remedy in chastity and\ncontinence, alike in marriage and in widowhood; also in the\nabstaining from all such indulgences of eating, drinking, and\nsleeping as inflame the passions, and from the company of all\nwho may tempt to the sin. Minute guidance is given as to the\nduty of confessing fully and faithfully the circumstances that\nattend and may aggravate this sin; and the Treatise then passes\nto the consideration of the conditions that are essential to a true\nand profitable confession of sin in general. First, it must be in\nsorrowful bitterness of spirit; a condition that has five signs --\nshamefastness, humility in heart and outward sign, weeping with\nthe bodily eyes or in the heart, disregard of the shame that\nmight curtail or garble confession, and obedience to the penance\nenjoined. Secondly, true confession must be promptly made, for\ndread of death, of increase of sinfulness, of forgetfulness of\nwhat should be confessed, of Christ's refusal to hear if it be put\noff to the last day of life; and this condition has four terms; that\nconfession be well pondered beforehand, that the man\nconfessing have comprehended in his mind the number and\ngreatness of his sins and how long he has lain in sin, that he be\ncontrite for and eschew his sins, and that he fear and flee the\noccasions for that sin to which he is inclined. -- What follows\nunder this head is of some interest for the light which it throws\non the rigorous government wielded by the Romish Church in\nthose days --]\n\nAlso thou shalt shrive thee of all thy sins to one man, and not a\nparcel [portion] to one man, and a parcel to another; that is to\nunderstand, in intent to depart [divide] thy confession for shame\nor dread; for it is but strangling of thy soul. For certes Jesus\nChrist is entirely all good, in him is none imperfection, and\ntherefore either he forgiveth all perfectly, or else never a deal\n[not at all]. I say not that if thou be assigned to thy penitencer\n<9> for a certain sin, that thou art bound to shew him all the\nremnant of thy sins, of which thou hast been shriven of thy\ncurate, but if it like thee [unless thou be pleased] of thy\nhumility; this is no departing [division] of shrift. And I say not,\nwhere I speak of division of confession, that if thou have license\nto shrive thee to a discreet and an honest priest, and where thee\nliketh, and by the license of thy curate, that thou mayest not\nwell shrive thee to him of all thy sins: but let no blot be behind,\nlet no sin be untold as far as thou hast remembrance. And when\nthou shalt be shriven of thy curate, tell him eke all the sins that\nthou hast done since thou wert last shriven. This is no wicked\nintent of division of shrift. Also, very shrift [true confession]\nasketh certain  conditions. First, that thou shrive thee by thy\nfree will, not constrained, nor for shame of folk, nor for malady\n[sickness],  or such things: for it is reason, that he that\ntrespasseth by his free will, that by his free will he confess his\ntrespass; and that no other man tell his sin but himself; nor he\nshall not nay nor deny his sin, nor wrath him against the priest\nfor admonishing him to leave his sin. The second condition is,\nthat thy shrift be lawful, that is to say, that thou that shrivest\nthee, and eke the priest that heareth thy confession, be verily in\nthe faith of Holy Church, and that a man be not despaired of the\nmercy of Jesus Christ, as Cain and Judas were. And eke a man\nmust accuse himself of his own trespass, and not another: but he\nshall blame and wite [accuse] himself of his own malice and of\nhis sin, and none other: but nevertheless, if that another man be\noccasion or else enticer of his sin, or the estate of the person be\nsuch by which his sin is aggravated, or else that be may not\nplainly shrive him but [unless] he tell the person with which he\nhath sinned, then may he tell, so that his intent be not to\nbackbite the person, but only to declare his confession. Thou\nshalt not eke make no leasings [falsehoods] in thy confession\nfor humility, peradventure, to say that thou hast committed and\ndone such sins of which that thou wert never guilty. For Saint\nAugustine saith, \"If that thou, because of humility, makest a\nleasing on thyself, though thou were not in sin before, yet art\nthou then in sin through thy leasing.\" Thou must also shew thy\nsin by thine own proper mouth, but [unless] thou be dumb, and\nnot by letter; for thou that hast done the sin, thou shalt have the\nshame of the confession. Thou shalt not paint thy confession\nwith fair and subtle words, to cover the more thy sin; for then\nbeguilest thou thyself, and not the priest; thou must tell it\nplainly, be it never so foul nor so horrible. Thou shalt eke shrive\nthee to a priest that is discreet to counsel thee; and eke thou\nshalt not shrive thee for vain-glory, nor for hypocrisy, nor for\nno cause but only for the doubt [fear] of Jesus' Christ and the\nhealth of thy soul. Thou shalt not run to the priest all suddenly,\nto tell him lightly thy sin, as who telleth a jape [jest] or a tale,\nbut advisedly and with good devotion; and generally shrive thee\noft; if thou oft fall, oft arise by confession. And though thou\nshrive thee oftener than once of sin of which thou hast been\nshriven, it is more merit; and, as saith Saint Augustine, thou\nshalt have the more lightly [easily] release and grace of God,\nboth of sin and of pain. And certes, once a year at the least way,\nit is lawful to be houseled, <10> for soothly once a year all\nthings in the earth renovelen [renew themselves].\n\n[Here ends the Second Part of the Treatise; the Third Part,\nwhich contains the practical application of the whole, follows\nentire, along with the remarkable \"Prayer of Chaucer,\" as it\nstands in the Harleian Manuscript:--]\n\nDe Tertia Parte Poenitentiae. [Of the third part of penitence]\n\nNow have I told you of very [true] confession, that is the\nsecond part of penitence: The third part of penitence is\nsatisfaction, and that standeth generally in almsdeed and bodily\npain. Now be there three manner of almsdeed: contrition of\nheart, where a man offereth himself to God; the second is, to\nhave pity of the default of his neighbour; the third is, in giving\nof good counsel and comfort, ghostly and bodily, where men\nhave need, and namely [specially] sustenance of man's food.\nAnd take keep [heed] that a man hath need of these things\ngenerally; he hath need of food, of clothing, and of herberow\n[lodging], he hath need of charitable counsel and visiting in\nprison and malady, and sepulture of his dead body. And if thou\nmayest not visit the needful with thy person, visit them by thy\nmessage and by thy gifts. These be generally alms or works of\ncharity of them that have temporal riches or discretion in\ncounselling. Of these works shalt thou hear at the day of doom.\nThis alms shouldest thou do of thine own proper things, and\nhastily [promptly], and privily [secretly] if thou mayest; but\nnevertheless, if thou mayest not do it privily, thou shalt not\nforbear to do alms, though men see it, so that it be not done for\nthank of the world, but only for thank of Jesus Christ. For, as\nwitnesseth Saint Matthew, chap. v., \"A city may not be hid that\nis set on a mountain, nor men light not a lantern and put it\nunder a bushel, but men set it on a candlestick, to light the men\nin the house; right so shall your light lighten before men, that\nthey may see your good works, and glorify your Father that is\nin heaven.\"\n\nNow as to speak of bodily pain, it is in prayer, in wakings,\n[watchings] in fastings, and in virtuous teachings. Of orisons ye\nshall understand, that orisons or prayers is to say a piteous will\nof heart, that redresseth it in God, and expresseth it by word\noutward, to remove harms, and to have things spiritual and\ndurable, and sometimes temporal things. Of which orisons,\ncertes in the orison of the Pater noster hath our Lord Jesus\nChrist enclosed most things. Certes, it is privileged of three\nthings in its dignity, for which it is more digne [worthy] than\nany other prayer: for Jesus Christ himself made it: and it is\nshort, for [in order] it should be coude the more lightly, [be\nmore easily conned or learned] and to withhold [retain] it the\nmore easy in heart, and help himself the oftener with this orison;\nand for a man should be the less weary to say it; and for a man\nmay not excuse him to learn it, it is so short and so easy: and\nfor it comprehendeth in itself all good prayers. The exposition\nof this holy prayer, that is so excellent and so digne, I betake\n[commit] to these masters of theology; save thus much will I\nsay, when thou prayest that God should forgive thee thy guilts,\nas thou forgivest them that they guilt to thee, be full well ware\nthat thou be not out of charity. This holy orison aminisheth\n[lesseneth] eke venial sin, and therefore it appertaineth specially\nto penitence. This prayer must be truly said, and in very faith,\nand that men pray to God ordinately, discreetly, and devoutly;\nand always a man shall put his will to be subject to the will of\nGod. This orison must eke be said with great humbleness and\nfull pure, and honestly, and not to the annoyance of any man or\nwoman. It must eke be continued with the works of charity. It\navaileth against the vices of the soul; for, assaith Saint Jerome,\nby fasting be saved the vices of the flesh, and by prayer the\nvices of the soul\n\nAfter this thou shalt understand, that bodily pain stands in\nwaking [watching].  For Jesus Christ saith \"Wake and pray, that\nye enter not into temptation.\" Ye shall understand also, that\nfasting stands in three things: in forbearing of bodily meat and\ndrink, and in forbearing of worldly jollity, and in forbearing of\ndeadly sin; this is to say, that a man shall keep him from deadly\nsin in all that he may. And thou shalt understand eke, that God\nordained fasting; and to fasting appertain four things: largeness\n[generosity] to poor folk; gladness of heart spiritual; not to be\nangry nor annoyed nor grudge [murmur] for he fasteth; and also\nreasonable hour for to eat by measure; that is to say, a man\nshould not eat in untime [out of time],  nor sit the longer at his\nmeal for [because] he fasteth. Then shalt thou understand, that\nbodily pain standeth in discipline, or teaching, by word, or by\nwriting, or by ensample. Also in wearing of hairs [haircloth] or\nof stamin [coarse hempen cloth], or of habergeons [mail-shirts]\n<11> on their naked flesh for Christ's sake; but ware thee well\nthat such manner penance of thy flesh make not thine heart\nbitter or angry, nor annoyed of thyself; for better is to cast away\nthine hair than to cast away the sweetness of our Lord Jesus\nChrist. And therefore saith Saint Paul, \"Clothe you, as they that\nbe chosen of God in heart, of misericorde [with compassion],\ndebonairte [gentleness], sufferance [patience], and such manner\nof clothing,\" of which Jesus Christ is more apaid [better\npleased] than of hairs or of hauberks. Then is discipline eke in\nknocking of thy breast, in scourging with yards [rods], in\nkneelings, in tribulations, in suffering patiently wrongs that be\ndone to him, and eke in patient sufferance of maladies, or losing\nof worldly catel [chattels], or of wife, or of child, or of other\nfriends.\n\nThen shalt thou understand which things disturb penance, and\nthis is in four things; that is dread, shame, hope, and wanhope,\nthat is, desperation. And for to speak first of dread, for which\nhe weeneth that he may suffer no penance, thereagainst is\nremedy for to think that bodily penance is but short and little at\nthe regard of [in comparison with] the pain of hell, that is so\ncruel and so long, that it lasteth without end. Now against the\nshame that a man hath to shrive him, and namely [specially]\nthese hypocrites, that would be holden so perfect, that they\nhave no need to shrive them; against that shame should a man\nthink, that by way of reason he that hath not been ashamed to\ndo foul things, certes he ought not to be ashamed to do fair\nthings, and that is confession. A man should eke think, that God\nseeth and knoweth all thy thoughts, and all thy works; to him\nmay nothing be hid nor covered. Men should eke remember\nthem of the shame that is to come at the day of doom, to them\nthat be not penitent and shriven in this present life; for all the\ncreatures in heaven, and in earth, and in hell, shall see apertly\n[openly] all that he hideth in this world.\n\nNow for to speak of them that be so negligent and slow to\nshrive them; that stands in two manners. The one is, that he\nhopeth to live long, and to purchase [acquire] much riches for\nhis delight, and then he will shrive him: and, as he sayeth, he\nmay, as him seemeth, timely enough come to shrift: another is,\nthe surquedrie [presumption <12>] that he hath in Christ's\nmercy. Against the first vice, he shall think that our life is in no\nsickerness, [security] and eke that all the riches in this world be\nin adventure, and pass as a shadow on the wall; and, as saith St\nGregory, that it appertaineth to the great righteousness of God,\nthat never shall the pain stint [cease] of them, that never would\nwithdraw them from sin, their thanks [with their goodwill], but\naye continue in sin; for that perpetual will to do sin shall they\nhave perpetual pain. Wanhope [despair] is in two manners [of\ntwo kinds]. The first wanhope is, in the mercy of God: the other\nis, that they think they might not long persevere in goodness.\nThe first wanhope cometh of that he deemeth that he sinned so\nhighly and so oft, and so long hath lain in sin, that he shall not\nbe saved. Certes against that cursed wanhope should he think,\nthat the passion of Jesus Christ is more strong for to unbind,\nthan sin is strong for to bind. Against the second wanhope he\nshall think, that as oft as he falleth, he may arise again by\npenitence; and though he never so long hath lain in sin, the\nmercy of Christ is always ready to receive him to mercy.\nAgainst the wanhope that he thinketh he should not long\npersevere in goodness, he shall think that the feebleness of the\ndevil may nothing do, but [unless] men will suffer him; and eke\nhe shall have strength of the help of God, and of all Holy\nChurch, and of the protection of angels, if him list.\n\nThen shall men understand, what is the fruit of penance; and\nafter the word of Jesus Christ, it is the endless bliss of heaven,\nwhere joy hath no contrariety of woe nor of penance nor\ngrievance; there all harms be passed of this present life; there as\nis the sickerness [security] from the pain of hell; there as is the\nblissful company, that rejoice them evermore each of the other's\njoy; there as the body of man, that whilom was foul and dark, is\nmore clear than the sun; there as the body of man that whilom\nwas sick and frail, feeble and mortal, is immortal, and so strong\nand so whole, that there may nothing apair [impair, injure] it;\nthere is neither hunger, nor thirst, nor cold, but every soul\nreplenished with the sight of the perfect knowing of God. This\nblissful regne [kingdom] may men purchase by poverty spiritual,\nand the glory by lowliness, the plenty of joy by hunger and\nthirst, the rest by travail, and the life by death and mortification\nof sin; to which life He us bring, that bought us with his\nprecious blood! Amen.\n\n\nNotes to the Parson's Tale\n\n\n1. The Parson's Tale is believed to be a translation, more or less\nfree, from some treatise on penitence that was in favour about\nChaucer's time. Tyrwhitt says: \"I cannot recommend it as a very\nentertaining or edifying performance at this day; but the reader\nwill please to remember, in excuse both of Chaucer and of his\neditor, that, considering The Canterbury Tales as a great picture\nof life and manners, the piece would not have been complete if\nit had not included the religion of the time.\" The Editor of the\npresent volume has followed the same plan adopted with regard\nto Chaucer's Tale of Meliboeus, and mainly for the same\nreasons. (See note 1 to that Tale). An outline of the Parson's\nponderous sermon -- for such it is -- has been drawn; while\nthose passages have been given in full which more directly\nillustrate the social and the religious life of the time -- such as\nthe picture of hell, the vehement and rather coarse, but, in an\nantiquarian sense, most curious and valuable attack on the\nfashionable garb of the day, the catalogue of venial sins, the\ndescription of gluttony and its remedy, &c. The brief third or\nconcluding part, which contains the application of the whole,\nand the \"Retractation\" or \"Prayer\" that closes the Tale and the\nentire \"magnum opus\" of Chaucer, have been given in full.\n\n2. Jeremiah vi. 16.\n\n3. See Note 3 to the Sompnour's Tale.\n\n4. Just before, the Parson had cited the words of Job to God\n(Job x. 20-22), \"Suffer, Lord, that I may a while bewail and\nweep, ere I go without returning to the dark land, covered with\nthe darkness of death; to the land of misease and of darkness,\nwhere as is the shadow of death; where as is no order nor\nordinance, but grisly dread that ever shall last.\"\n\n5. \"I have lost everything - my time and my work.\"\n\n6. Accidie: neglectfulness or indifference; from the Greek,\nakedeia.\n\n7. The pax: an image which was presented to the people to be\nkissed, at that part of the mass where the priest said, \"Pax\nDomini sit semper vobiscum.\" (\"May the peace of the Lord be\nalways with you\") The ceremony took the place, for greater\nconvenience, of the \"kiss of peace,\" which clergy and people, at\nthis passage, used to bestow upon each other.\n\n8. Three ways of ornamenting clothes with lace, &c.; in barring\nit was laid on crossways, in ounding it was waved, in paling it\nwas laid on lengthways.\n\n9. Penitencer: a priest who enjoined penance in extraordinary\ncases.\n\n10. To be houseled: to receive the holy sacrament; from Anglo-\nSaxon, \"husel;\" Latin, \"hostia,\" or \"hostiola,\" the host.\n\n11. It was a frequent penance among the chivalric orders to\nwear mail shirts next the skin.\n\n12. Surquedrie: presumption; from old French, \"surcuider,\" to\nthink arrogantly, be full of conceit.\n\n\n\n*PRECES DE CHAUCERES* <1>                            *Prayer of Chaucer*\n\n\nNow pray I to you all that hear this little treatise or read it, that\nif there be anything in it that likes them, that thereof they thank\nour Lord Jesus Christ, of whom proceedeth all wit and all\ngoodness; and if there be anything that displeaseth them, I pray\nthem also that they arette [impute] it to the default of mine\nunconning [unskilfulness], and not to my will, that would fain\nhave said better if I had had conning; for the book saith, all that\nis written for our doctrine is written. Wherefore I beseech you\nmeekly for the mercy of God that ye pray for me, that God have\nmercy on me and forgive me my guilts, and namely [specially]\nmy translations and of inditing in worldly vanities, which I\nrevoke in my Retractions, as is the Book of Troilus, the Book\nalso of Fame, the Book of Twenty-five Ladies, the Book of the\nDuchess, the Book of Saint Valentine's Day and of the\nParliament of Birds, the Tales of Canter bury, all those that\nsounen unto sin, [are sinful, tend towards sin] the Book of the\nLion, and many other books, if they were in my mind or\nremembrance, and many a song and many a lecherous lay, of the\nwhich Christ for his great mercy forgive me the sins. But of the\ntranslation of Boece de Consolatione, and other books of\nconsolation and of legend of lives of saints, and homilies, and\nmoralities, and devotion, that thank I our Lord Jesus Christ, and\nhis mother, and all the saints in heaven, beseeching them that\nthey from henceforth unto my life's end send me grace to bewail\nmy guilts, and to study to the salvation of my soul, and grant\nme grace and space of very repentance, penitence, confession,\nand satisfaction, to do in this present life, through the benign\ngrace of Him that is King of kings and Priest of all priests, that\nbought us with his precious blood of his heart, so that I may be\none of them at the day of doom that shall be saved: Qui cum\nPatre et Spiritu Sancto vivis et regnas Deus per omnia secula.\nAmen. <2>\n\n\nNotes to the Prayer of Chaucer\n\n\n1. The genuineness and real significance of this \"Prayer of\nChaucer,\" usually called his \"Retractation,\" have been warmly\ndisputed. On the one hand, it has been declared that the monks\nforged the retractation. and procured its insertion among the\nworks of the man who had done so much to expose their abuses\nand ignorance, and to weaken their hold on popular credulity:\non the other hand, Chaucer himself at the close of his life, is\nsaid to have greatly lamented the ribaldry and the attacks on the\nclergy which marked especially \"The Canterbury Tales,\" and to\nhave drawn up a formal retractation of which the \"Prayer\" is\neither a copy or an abridgment. The beginning and end of the\n\"Prayer,\" as Tyrwhitt points out, are in tone and terms quite\nappropriate in the mouth of the Parson, while they carry on the\nsubject of which he has been treating; and, despite the fact that\nMr Wright holds the contrary opinion, Tyrwhitt seems to be\njustified in setting down the \"Retractation\" as interpolated into\nthe close of the Parson's Tale. Of the circumstances under\nwhich the interpolation was made, or the causes by which it was\ndictated, little or nothing can now be confidently affirmed; but\nthe agreement of the manuscripts and the early editions in\ngiving it, render it impossible to discard it peremptorily as a\ndeclaration of prudish or of interested regret, with which\nChaucer himself had nothing whatever to do.\n\n2. \"[You] Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit livest and\nreignest God for ever and ever. Amen.\"\n\n\nTHE END OF THE CANTERBURY TALES\n\n\n\n                       THE COURT OF LOVE.\n\n\n\"The Court Of Love\" was probably Chaucer's first poem of any\nconsequence. It is believed to have been written at the age, and\nunder the circumstances, of which it contains express mention;\nthat is, when the poet was eighteen years old, and resided as a\nstudent at Cambridge, -- about the year 1346. The composition\nis marked by an elegance, care, and finish very different from\nthe bold freedom which in so great measure distinguishes the\nCanterbury Tales; and the fact is easily explained when we\nremember that, in the earlier poem, Chaucer followed a beaten\npath, in which he had many predecessors and competitors, all\nseeking to sound the praises of love with the grace, the\ningenuity, and studious devotion, appropriate to the theme. The\nstory of the poem is exceedingly simple. Under the name of\nPhilogenet, a clerk or scholar of Cambridge, the poet relates\nthat, summoned by Mercury to the Court of Love, he journeys\nto the splendid castle where the King and Queen of Love,\nAdmetus and Alcestis, keep their state. Discovering among the\ncourtiers a friend named Philobone, a chamberwoman to the\nQueen, Philogenet is led by her into a circular temple, where, in\na tabernacle, sits Venus, with Cupid by her side. While he is\nsurveying the motley crowd of suitors to the goddess,\nPhilogenet is summoned back into the King's presence, chidden\nfor his tardiness in coming to Court, and commanded to swear\nobservance to the twenty Statutes of Love -- which are recited\nat length. Philogenet then makes his prayers and vows to\nVenus, desiring that he may have for his love a lady whom he\nhas seen in a dream; and Philobone introduces him to the lady\nherself, named Rosial, to whom he does suit and service of love.\nAt first the lady is obdurate to his entreaties; but, Philogenet\nhaving proved the sincerity of his passion by a fainting fit,\nRosial relents, promises her favour, and orders Philobone to\nconduct him round the Court. The courtiers are then minutely\ndescribed; but the description is broken off abruptly, and we are\nintroduced to Rosial in the midst of a confession of her love.\nFinally she commands Philogenet to abide with her until the\nFirst of May, when the King of Love will hold high festival; he\nobeys; and the poem closes with the May Day festival service,\ncelebrated by a choir of birds, who sing an ingenious, but what\nmust have seemed in those days a more than slightly profane,\nparaphrase or parody of the matins for Trinity Sunday, to the\npraise of Cupid. From this outline, it will be seen at once that\nChaucer's \"Court of Love\" is in important particulars different\nfrom the institutions which, in the two centuries preceding his\nown, had so much occupied the attention of poets and gallants,\nand so powerfully controlled the social life of the noble and\nrefined classes. It is a regal, not a legal, Court which the poet\npictures to us; we are not introduced to a regularly constituted\nand authoritative tribunal in which nice questions of conduct in\nthe relations of lovers are discussed and decided -- but to the\ncentral and sovereign seat of Love's authority, where the\nstatutes are moulded, and the decrees are issued, upon which\nthe inferior and special tribunals we have mentioned frame their\nproceedings. The \"Courts of Love,\" in Chaucer's time, had lost\nnone of the prestige and influence which had been conferred\nupon them by the patronage and participation of Kings, Queens,\nEmperors, and Popes. But the institution, in its legal or judicial\ncharacter, was peculiar to France; and although the whole spirit\nof Chaucer's poem, especially as regards the esteem and\nreverence in which women were held, is that which animated\nthe French Courts, his treatment of the subject is broader and\nmore general, consequently more fitted to enlist the interest of\nEnglish readers.\n(Transcriber's note: Modern scholars believe that Chaucer was\nnot the author of this poem)\n\nThe poem consists of 206 stanzas of seven lines each; of which,\nin this edition, eighty-three are represented by a prose\nabridgement.\n\nWith timorous heart, and trembling hand of dread,\nOf cunning* naked, bare of eloquence,                             *skill\nUnto the *flow'r of port in womanhead*        *one who is the perfection\nI write, as he that none intelligence              of womanly behaviour*\nOf metres hath, <1> nor flowers of sentence,\nSave that me list my writing to convey,\nIn that I can, to please her high nobley.*                    *nobleness\n\nThe blossoms fresh of Tullius'* garden swoot**           *Cicero **sweet\nPresent they not, my matter for to born:* <2>           *burnish, polish\nPoems of Virgil take here no root,\nNor craft of Galfrid <3> may not here sojourn;\nWhy *n'am I* cunning?

Seeing at last a crowd of\npeople, \"as bees,\" making their way thither, the\npoet asked whither they went; and \"one that\nanswer'd like a maid\" said that they were bound to\nthe Court of Love, at Citheron,  where \"the King\nof Love, and all his noble rout [company],\n\n\"Dwelleth within a castle royally.\"\nSo them apace I journey'd forth among,\nAnd as he said, so found I there truly;\nFor I beheld the town -- so high and strong,\nAnd high pinnacles, large of height and long,\nWith plate of gold bespread on ev'ry side,\nAnd precious stones, the stone work for to hide.\n\nNo sapphire of Ind, no ruby rich of price,\nThere lacked then, nor emerald so green,\nBalais, Turkeis, <9> nor thing, *to my devise,*        *in my judgement*\nThat may the castle make for to sheen;*                    *be beautiful\nAll was as bright as stars in winter be'n;\nAnd Phoebus shone, to make his peace again,\nFor trespass* done to high estates twain,  --                   *offence\n\nWhen he had found Venus in the arms of Mars, and hastened to\ntell Vulcan of his wife's infidelity <10>. Now he was shining\nbrightly on the castle, \"in sign he looked after Love's grace;\" for\nthere is no god in Heaven or in Hell \"but he hath been right\nsubject unto Love.\" Continuing his description of the castle,\nPhilogenet says that he saw never any so large and high; within\nand without, it was painted \"with many a thousand daisies, red\nas rose,\" and white also, in signification of whom, he knew not;\nunless it was the flower of Alcestis <11>, who, under Venus,\nwas queen of the place, as Admetus was king;\n\nTo whom obey'd the ladies good nineteen <12>,\nWith many a thousand other, bright of face.\nAnd young men fele* came forth with lusty pace,               *many <13>\nAnd aged eke, their homage to dispose;\nBut what they were, I could not well disclose.\n\nYet nere* and nere* forth in I gan me dress,                     *nearer\nInto a hall of noble apparail,*                             *furnishings\nWith arras <14> spread, and cloth of gold, I guess,\nAnd other silk *of easier avail;*    *less difficult, costly, to attain*\nUnder the *cloth of their estate,* sans fail,             *state canopy*\nThe King and Queen there sat, as I beheld;\nIt passed joy of *Elysee the feld.*                 *The Elysian Fields*\n\nThere saintes* have their coming and resort,           *martyrs for love\nTo see the King so royally beseen,*                             *adorned\nIn purple clad, and eke the Queen *in sort;*                  *suitably*\nAnd on their heades saw I crownes twain,\nWith stones frett,* so that it was no pain,                     *adorned\nWithoute meat or drink, to stand and see\nThe Kinge's honour and the royalty.\n\nTo treat of state affairs, Danger <15> stood by the\nKing, and Disdain by the Queen; who cast her eyes\nhaughtily about, sending forth beams that seemed\n\"shapen like a dart, sharp and piercing, and small and\nstraight of line;\" while her hair shone as gold so fine,\n\"dishevel, crisp, down hanging at her back a yard in\nlength.\" <16> Amazed and dazzled by her beauty,\nPhilogenet stood perplexed, till he spied a Maid,\nPhilobone -- a chamberwoman of the Queen's -- who\nasked how and on what errand he came thither.\nLearning that he had been summoned by Mercury, she\ntold him that he ought to have come of his free will,\nand that he \"will be shent [rebuked, disgraced]\"\nbecause he did not.\n\n\"For ye that reign in youth and lustiness,\nPamper'd with ease, and jealous in your age,\nYour duty is, as far as I can guess,\nTo Love's Court to dresse* your voyage,                 *direct, address\nAs soon as Nature maketh you so sage\nThat ye may know a woman from a swan, <17>\nOr when your foot is growen half a span.\n\n\"But since that ye, by wilful negligence,\nThis eighteen year have kept yourself at large,\nThe greater is your trespass and offence,\nAnd in your neck you must bear all the charge:\nFor better were ye be withoute barge*                              *boat\nAmid the sea in tempest and in rain,\nThan bide here, receiving woe and pain\n\n\"That ordained is for such as them absent\nFrom Love's Court by yeares long and fele.*                         many\nI lay* my life ye shall full soon repent;

those who knelt in blue wore the colour in\nsign of their changeless truth <21>; those in black,\nwho uttered cries of grief, were the sick and dying of\nlove. The priests, nuns, hermits, and friars, and all that\nsat in white, in russet and in green, \"wailed of their\nwoe;\" and for all people, of every degree, the Court\nwas open and free. While he walked about with\nPhilobone, a messenger from the King entered, and\nsummoned all the new-come folk to the royal\npresence. Trembling and pale, Philogenet approached\nthe throne of Admetus, and was sternly asked why he\ncame so late to Court. He pleaded that a hundred\ntimes he had been at the gate, but had been prevented\nfrom entering by failure to see any of his\nacquaintances, and by shamefacedness. The King\npardoned him, on condition that thenceforth he should\nserve Love; and the poet took oath to do so, \"though\nDeath therefor me thirle [pierce] with his spear.\"\nWhen the King had seen all the new-comers, he\ncommanded an officer to take their oaths of\nallegiance, and show them the Statutes of the Court,\nwhich must be observed till death.\n\nAnd, for that I was letter'd, there I read\nThe statutes whole of Love's Court and hail:\nThe first statute that on the book was spread,\nWas, To be true in thought and deedes all\nUnto the King of Love, the lord royal;\nAnd, to the Queen, as faithful and as kind\nAs I could think with hearte, will, and mind.\n\nThe second statute, Secretly to keep\nCounsel* of love, not blowing** ev'rywhere            *secrets **talking\nAll that I know, and let it sink and fleet;*                      *float\nIt may not sound in ev'ry wighte's ear:\nExiling slander ay for dread and fear,\nAnd to my lady, which I love and serve,\nBe true and kind, her grace for to deserve.\n\nThe third statute was clearly writ also,\nWithoute change to live and die the same,\nNone other love to take, for weal nor woe,\nFor blind delight, for earnest nor for game:\nWithout repent, for laughing or for grame,*            *vexation, sorrow\nTo bide still in full perseverance:\nAll this was whole the Kinge's ordinance.\n\nThe fourth statute, To *purchase ever to her,*       *promote her cause*\nAnd stirre folk to love, and bete* fire                          *kindle\nOn Venus' altar, here about and there,\nAnd preach to them of love and hot desire,\nAnd tell how love will quite* well their hire:                   *reward\nThis must be kept;

and, after taking the oath,\nPhilogenet turned over other leaves of the book,\ncontaining the statutes of women. But Rigour sternly\nbade him forbear; for no man might know the statutes\nthat belong to women.\n\n\"In secret wise they kepte be full close;\nThey sound* each one to liberty, my friend;                *tend, accord\nPleasant they be, and to their own purpose;\nThere wot* no wight of them, but God and fiend,                   *knows\nNor aught shall wit, unto the worlde's end.\nThe queen hath giv'n me charge, in pain to die,\nNever to read nor see them with mine eye.\n\n\"For men shall not so near of counsel be'n\nWith womanhead, nor knowen of their guise,\nNor what they think, nor of their wit th'engine;*                 *craft\n*I me report to* Solomon the wise, <25>           *I refer for proof to*\nAnd mighty Samson, which beguiled thrice\nWith Delilah was; he wot that, in a throw,\nThere may no man statute of women know.\n\n\"For it peradventure may right so befall,\nThat they be bound by nature to deceive,\nAnd spin, and weep, and sugar strew on gall, <26>\nThe heart of man to ravish and to reave,\nAnd whet their tongue as sharp as sword or gleve:*        *glaive, sword\nIt may betide this is their ordinance,\nSo must they lowly do their observance,\n\n\"And keep the statute given them *of kind,*                  *by nature*\nOf such as Love hath giv'n them in their life.\nMen may not wit why turneth every wind,\nNor waxe wise, nor be inquisitife\nTo know secret of maid, widow, or wife;\nFor they their statutes have to them reserved,\nAnd never man to know them hath deserved.\"\n\nRigour then sent them forth to pay court to Venus,\nand pray her to teach them how they might serve and\nplease their dames, or to provide with ladies those\nwhose hearts were yet vacant. Before Venus knelt a\nthousand sad petitioners, entreating her to punish \"the\nfalse untrue,\" that had broken their vows, \"barren of\nruth, untrue of what they said, now that their lust and\npleasure is allay'd.\" But the mourners were in a\nminority;\n\nYet eft again, a thousand million,\nRejoicing, love, leading their life in bliss:\nThey said: \"Venus, redress* of all division,                     *healer\nGoddess eternal, thy name heried* is!                         *glorified\nBy love's bond is knit all thing, y-wis,*                     *assuredly\nBeast unto beast, the earth to water wan,*                         *pale\nBird unto bird, and woman unto man; <27>\n\n\"This is the life of joy that we be in,\nResembling life of heav'nly paradise;\nLove is exiler ay of vice and sin;\nLove maketh heartes lusty to devise;\nHonour and grace have they in ev'ry wise,\nThat be to love's law obedient;\nLove maketh folk benign and diligent;\n\n\"Aye stirring them to dreade vice and shame:\nIn their degree it makes them honourable;\nAnd sweet it is of love to bear the name,\nSo that his love be faithful, true, and stable:\nLove pruneth him to seemen amiable;\nLove hath no fault where it is exercis'd,\nBut sole* with them that have all love despis'd:\"                  *only\n\nAnd they conclude with grateful honours to the goddess\n-- rejoicing hat they are hers in heart, and all inflamed\nwith her grace and heavenly fear. Philogenet now\nentreats the goddess to remove his grief; for he also\nloves, and hotly, only he does not know where --\n\n\"Save only this, by God and by my troth;\nTroubled I was with slumber, sleep, and sloth\nThis other night, and in a vision\nI saw a woman roamen up and down,\n\n\"Of *mean stature,* and seemly to behold,              *middling height*\nLusty and fresh, demure of countenance,\nYoung and well shap'd, with haire sheen* as gold,               *shining\nWith eyne as crystal, farced* with pleasance;                   *crammed\nAnd she gan stir mine heart a lite* to dance;                    *little\nBut suddenly she vanish gan right there:\nThus I may say, I love, and wot* not where.\"                       *know\n\nIf he could only know this lady, he would serve and obey her\nwith all benignity; but if his destiny were otherwise, he would\ngladly love and serve his lady, whosoever she might be. He\ncalled on Venus for help to possess his queen and heart's life,\nand vowed daily war with Diana: \"that goddess chaste I keepen\n[care] in no wise to serve; a fig for all her chastity!\" Then he\nrose and went his way, passing by a rich and beautiful shrine,\nwhich, Philobone informed him, was the sepulchre of Pity. \"A\ntender creature,\" she said,\n\n\"Is shrined there, and Pity is her name.\nShe saw an eagle wreak* him on a fly,                            *avenge\nAnd pluck his wing, and eke him, *in his game;*              *for sport*\nAnd tender heart of that hath made her die:\nEke she would weep, and mourn right piteously,\nTo see a lover suffer great distress.\nIn all the Court was none, as I do guess,\n\n\"That could a lover half so well avail,*                           *help\nNor of his woe the torment or the rage\nAslake;* for he was sure, withoute fail,                        *assuage\nThat of his grief she could the heat assuage.\nInstead of Pity, speedeth hot Courage\nThe matters all of Court, now she is dead;\n*I me report in this to womanhead.*         *for evidence I refer to the\n                                         behaviour of women themselves.*\n\n\"For wail, and weep, and cry, and speak, and pray, --\nWomen would not have pity on thy plaint;\nNor by that means to ease thine heart convey,\nBut thee receive for their own talent:*                     *inclination\nAnd say that Pity caus'd thee, in consent\nOf ruth,* to take thy service and thy pain,                  *compassion\nIn that thou may'st, to please thy sovereign.\"\n\nPhilobone now promised to lead Philogenet to \"the fairest lady\nunder sun that is,\" the \"mirror of joy and bliss,\" whose name is\nRosial, and \"whose heart as yet is given to no wight;\"\nsuggesting that, as he also was \"with love but light advanc'd,\"\nhe might set this lady in the place of her of whom he had\ndreamed. Entering a chamber gay, \"there was Rosial, womanly\nto see;\" and the subtle-piercing beams of her eyes wounded\nPhilogenet to the heart.

Philogenet\nprotests his gratitude to Pity, his faithfulness to Rosial; and the\nlady, thanking him heartily, bids him abide with her till the\nseason of May, when the King of Love and all his company will\nhold his feast fully royally and well. \"And there I bode till that\nthe season fell.\"\n\nOn May Day, when the lark began to rise,\nTo matins went the lusty nightingale,\nWithin a temple shapen hawthorn-wise;\nHe might not sleep in all the nightertale,*                  *night-time\nBut \"Domine\" <44> gan he cry and gale,*                        *call out\n\"My lippes open, Lord of Love, I cry,\nAnd let my mouth thy praising now bewry.\"*                   *show forth\n\nThe eagle sang \"Venite,\" <45> bodies all,\nAnd let us joy to love that is our health.\"\nAnd to the desk anon they gan to fall,\nAnd who came late he pressed in by stealth\nThen said the falcon, \"Our own heartes' wealth,\n'Domine Dominus noster,' <46> I wot,\nYe be the God that do* us burn thus hot.\"                          *make\n\n\"Coeli enarrant,\" <47> said the popinjay,*                       *parrot\n\"Your might is told in Heav'n and firmament.\"\nAnd then came in the goldfinch fresh and gay,\nAnd said this psalm with heartly glad intent,\n\"Domini est terra;\" <48> this Latin intent,*                      *means\nThe God of Love hath earth in governance:\nAnd then the wren began to skip and dance.\n\n\"Jube Domine; <49> O Lord of Love, I pray\nCommand me well this lesson for to read;\nThis legend is of all that woulde dey*                              *die\nMartyrs for love; God yet their soules speed!\nAnd to thee, Venus, sing we, *out of dread,*             *without doubt*\nBy influence of all thy virtue great,\nBeseeching thee to keep us in our heat.\"\n\nThe second lesson robin redbreast sang,\n\"Hail to the God and Goddess of our lay!\"*                *law, religion\nAnd to the lectern amorously he sprang:\n\"Hail now,\" quoth be, \"O fresh season of May,\n*Our moneth glad that singen on the spray!*      *glad month for us that\nHail to the flowers, red, and white, and blue,      sing upon the bough*\nWhich by their virtue maken our lust new!\"\n\nThe third lesson the turtle-dove took up,\nAnd thereat laugh'd the mavis* in a scorn:                    *blackbird\nHe said, \"O God, as might I dine or sup,\nThis foolish dove will give us all a horn!\nThere be right here a thousand better born,\nTo read this lesson, which as well as he,\nAnd eke as hot, can love in all degree.\"\n\nThe turtle-dove said, \"Welcome, welcome May,\nGladsome and light to lovers that be true!\nI thank thee, Lord of Love, that doth purvey\nFor me to read this lesson all *of due;*                   *in due form*\nFor, in good sooth, *of corage* I pursue             *with all my heart*\nTo serve my make* till death us must depart:\"                      *mate\nAnd then \"Tu autem\" <50> sang he all apart.\n\n\"Te Deum amoris\" <51> sang the throstel* cock:                   *thrush\nTubal <52> himself, the first musician,\nWith key of harmony could not unlock\nSo sweet a tune as that the throstel can:\n\"The Lord of Love we praise,\" quoth he than,*                      *then\nAnd so do all the fowles great and lite;*                        *little\n\"Honour we May, in false lovers' despite.\"\n\n\"Dominus regnavit,\" <53> said the peacock there,\n\"The Lord of Love, that mighty prince, y-wis,\nHe is received here and ev'rywhere:\nNow Jubilate <54> sing:\" \"What meaneth this?\"\nSaid then the linnet; \"welcome, Lord of bliss!\"\nOut start the owl with \"Benedicite,\" <55>\n\"What meaneth all this merry fare?\"* quoth he.              *doing, fuss\n\n\"Laudate,\" <56> sang the lark with voice full shrill;\nAnd eke the kite \"O admirabile;\" <57>\nThis quire* will through mine eares pierce and thrill;            *choir\nBut what?

So the Man of Law, in the prologue to his Tale, is made to\nsay that Chaucer \"can but lewedly (ignorantly or imperfectly) on\nmetres and on rhyming craftily.\" But the humility of those\napologies is not justified by the care and finish of his earlier\npoems.\n\n2. Born: burnish, polish: the poet means, that his verses do not\ndisplay the eloquence or brilliancy of Cicero in setting forth his\nsubject-matter.\n\n3. Galfrid: Geoffrey de Vinsauf to whose treatise on poetical\ncomposition a less flattering allusion is made in The Nun's\nPriest's Tale. See note 33 to that Tale.\n\n4. Stirp: race, stock; Latin, \"stirps.\"\n\n5. Calliope is the epic muse -- \"sister\" to the other eight.\n\n6. Melpomene was the tragic muse.\n\n7. The same is said of Griselda, in The Clerk's Tale; though she\nwas of tender years, \"yet in the breast of her virginity there was\ninclos'd a sad and ripe corage\"\n\n8. The confusion which Chaucer makes between Cithaeron and\nCythera, has already been remarked.  See note 41 to the\nKnight's Tale.\n\n9. Balais: Bastard rubies; said to be so called from Balassa, the\nAsian country where they were found. Turkeis: turquoise\nstones.\n\n10. Spenser, in his description of the House of Busirane, speaks\nof the sad distress into which Phoebus was plunged by Cupid, in\nrevenge for the betrayal of \"his mother's wantonness, when she\nwith Mars was meint [mingled] in joyfulness\"\n\n11. Alcestis, daughter of Pelias, was won to wife by Admetus,\nKing of Pherae, who complied with her father's demand that he\nshould come to claim her in a chariot drawn by lions and boars.\nBy the aid of Apollo -- who tended the flocks of Admetus\nduring his banishment from heaven -- the suitor fulfilled the\ncondition; and Apollo further induced the Moirae or Fates to\ngrant that Admetus should never die, if his father, mother, or\nwife would die for him. Alcestis devoted herself in his stead;\nand, since each had made great efforts or sacrifices for love, the\npair are fitly placed as king and queen in the Court of Love.\n\n12. In the prologue to the \"Legend of Good Women,\" Chaucer\nsays that behind the God of Love, upon the green, he \"saw\ncoming in ladies nineteen;\" but the stories of only nine good\nwomen are there told. In the prologue to The Man of Law's\nTale, sixteen ladies are named as having their stories written in\nthe \"Saints' Legend of Cupid\" -- now known as the \"Legend of\nGood Women\" -- (see note 5 to the Prologue to the Man of\nLaw's Tale); and in the \"Retractation,\" at the end of the Parson's\nTale, the \"Book of the Twenty-five Ladies\" is enumerated\namong the works of which the poet repents -- but there \"xxv\" is\nsupposed to have been by some copyist written for \"xix.\"\n\n13. fele: many; German, \"viele.\"\n\n14. Arras: tapestry of silk, made at Arras, in France.\n\n15. Danger, in the Provencal Courts of Love, was the\nallegorical personification of the husband; and Disdain suitably\nrepresents the lover's corresponding difficulty from the side of\nthe lady.\n\n16. In The Knight's Tale, Emily's yellow hair is braided in a\ntress, or plait, that hung a yard long behind her back; so that,\nboth as regards colour and fashion, a singular resemblance\nseems to have existed between the female taste of 1369 and that\nof 1869.\n\n17. In an old monkish story -- reproduced by Boccaccio, and\nfrom him by La Fontaine in the Tale called \"Les Oies de Frere\nPhilippe\"  -- a young man is brought up without sight or\nknowledge of women, and, when he sees them on a visit to the\ncity, he is told that they are geese.\n\n18. Tabernacle: A shrine or canopy of stone, supported by\npillars.\n\n19. Mister folk:  handicraftsmen, or tradesmen, who have\nlearned \"mysteries.\"\n\n20. The loves \"Of Queen Annelida and False Arcite\" formed the\nsubject of a short unfinished poem by Chaucer, which was\nafterwards worked up into The Knight's Tale.\n\n21. Blue was the colour of truth. See note 36 to the Squire's\nTale.\n\n22. Blife: quickly, eagerly; for \"blive\" or \"belive.\"\n\n23. It will be seen afterwards that Philogenet does not relish it,\nand pleads for its relaxation.\n\n24. Feat: dainty, neat, handsome; the same as \"fetis,\" oftener\nused in Chaucer; the adverb \"featly\" is still used, as applied to\ndancing, &c.\n\n25. Solomon was beguiled by his heathenish wives to forsake\nthe worship of the true God; Samson fell a victim to the wiles of\nDelilah.\n\n26. Compare the speech of Proserpine to Pluto, in The\nMerchant's Tale.\n\n27. See note 91 to the Knight's Tale for a parallel.\n\n28. Flaw: yellow; Latin, \"flavus,\" French, \"fauve.\"\n\n29. Bass: kiss; French, \"baiser;\" and hence the more vulgar\n\"buss.\"\n\n30. Maximian: Cornelius Maximianus Gallus flourished in the\ntime of the Emperor Anastasius; in one of his elegies, he\nprofessed a preference for flaming and somewhat swelling lips,\nwhich, when he tasted them, would give him full kisses.\n\n31. Dwale: sleeping potion, narcotic. See note 19 to the Reeve's\nTale.\n\n32. Environ: around; French, \"a l'environ.\"\n\n33. Cast off thine heart: i.e.  from confidence in her.\n\n34. Nesh: soft, delicate; Anglo-Saxon, \"nese.\"\n\n35. Perfection: Perfectly holy life, in the performance of vows\nof poverty, chastity, obedience, and other modes of mortifying\nthe flesh.\n\n36. All the sin must on our friendes be: who made us take the\nvows before they knew our own dispositions, or ability, to keep\nthem.\n\n37. Cope: The large vestment worn in singing the service in the\nchoir. In Chaucer's time it seems to have been a distinctively\nclerical piece of dress; so, in the prologue to The Monk's Tale,\nthe Host, lamenting that so stalwart a man as the Monk should\nhave gone into religion, exclaims, \"Alas! why wearest thou so\nwide a cope?\"\n\n38. The three of fatal destiny: The three Fates.\n\n39. Cythere:  Cytherea  --  Venus, so called from the name of\nthe island, Cythera, into which her worship was first introduced\nfrom Phoenicia.\n\n40. Avaunter: Boaster; Philobone calls him out.\n\n41. The statute: i.e. the 16th.\n\n42. \"Metamorphoses\" Lib. ii. 768 et seqq., where a general\ndescription of Envy is given.\n\n43. Golden Love and Leaden Love represent successful and\nunsuccessful love; the first kindled by Cupid's golden darts, the\nsecond by his leaden arrows.\n\n44. \"Domine, labia mea aperies -- et os meam annunciabit\nlaudem tuam\" (\"Lord, open my lips -- and my mouth will\nannounce your praise\") Psalms li. 15, was the verse with which\nMatins began. The stanzas which follow contain a paraphrase of\nthe matins for Trinity Sunday, allegorically setting forth the\ndoctrine that love is the all-controlling influence in the\ngovernment of the\nuniverse.\n\n45. \"Venite, exultemus,\" (\"Come, let us rejoice\") are the first\nwords of Psalm xcv. called the \"Invitatory.\"\n\n46. \"Domine Dominus noster:\" The opening words of Psalm\nviii.; \"O Lord our Lord.\"\n\n47. \"Coeli enarrant:\" Psalm xix. 1; \"The heavens declare (thy\nglory).\"\n\n48. \"Domini est terra\": Psalm xxiv.

In The Knight's Tale we have exemplifications of the\ncustom of gathering and wearing flowers and branches on May\nDay; where Emily, \"doing observance to May,\" goes into the\ngarden at sunrise and gathers flowers, \"party white and red, to\nmake a sotel garland for her head\"; and again, where Arcite\nrides to the fields \"to make him a garland of the greves; were it\nof woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves\"\n\n\n\n                 THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE.\n\n\n[THE noble vindication of true love, as an exalting, purifying,\nand honour-conferring power, which Chaucer has made in \"The\nCourt of Love,\" is repeated in \"The Cuckoo and the\nNightingale.\" At the same time, the close of the poem leads up\nto \"The Assembly of Fowls;\" for, on the appeal of the\nNightingale, the dispute between her and the Cuckoo, on the\nmerits and blessings of love, is referred to a parliament of birds,\nto be held on the morrow after Saint Valentine's Day. True, the\nassembly of the feathered tribes described by Chaucer, though\nheld on Saint Valentine's Day, and engaged in the discussion of\na controversy regarding love, is not occupied with the particular\ncause which in the present poem the Nightingale appeals to the\nparliament. But \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale\" none the less\nserves as a link between the two poems; indicating as it does the\nnature of those controversies, in matters subject to the supreme\ncontrol of the King and Queen of Love, which in the subsequent\npoem we find the courtiers, under the guise of birds, debating in\nfull conclave and under legal forms. Exceedingly simple in\nconception, and written in a metre full of musical irregularity\nand forcible freedom, \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale\" yields\nin vividness, delicacy, and grace to none of Chaucer's minor\npoems. We are told that the poet, on the third night of May, is\nsleepless, and rises early in the morning, to try if he may hear\nthe Nightingale sing. Wandering by a brook-side, he sits down\non the flowery lawn, and ere long, lulled by the sweet melody of\nmany birds and the well-according music of the stream, he falls\ninto a kind of doze -- \"not all asleep, nor fully waking.\" Then\n(an evil omen) he hears the Cuckoo sing before the Nightingale;\nbut soon he hears the Nightingale request the Cuckoo to\nremove far away, and leave the place to birds that can sing. The\nCuckoo enters into a defence of her song, which becomes a\nrailing accusation against Love and a recital of the miseries\nwhich Love's servants endure; the Nightingale vindicates Love\nin a lofty and tender strain, but is at last overcome with sorrow\nby the bitter words of the Cuckoo, and calls on the God of\nLove for help. On this the poet starts up, and, snatching a stone\nfrom the brook, throws it at the Cuckoo, who flies away full\nfast. The grateful Nightingale promises that, for this service, she\nwill be her champion's singer all that May; she warns him\nagainst believing the Cuckoo, the foe of Love; and then, having\nsung him one of her new songs, she flies away to all the other\nbirds that are in that dale, assembles them, and demands that\nthey should do her right upon the Cuckoo. By one assent it is\nagreed that a parliament shall be held, \"the morrow after Saint\nValentine's Day,\" under a maple before the window of Queen\nPhilippa at Woodstock, when judgment shall be passed upon\nthe Cuckoo; then the Nightingale flies into a hawthorn, and\nsings a lay of love so loud that the poet awakes. The five-line\nstanza, of which the first, second, and fifth lines agree in one\nrhyme, the third and fourth in another, is peculiar to this poem;\nand while the prevailing measure is the decasyllabic line used in\nthe \"Canterbury Tales,\" many of the lines have one or two\nsyllables less. The poem is given here without abridgement.]\n(Transcriber's note: Modern scholars believe that Chaucer was\nnot the author of this poem)\n\n\nTHE God of Love, ah! benedicite,\nHow mighty and how

hear the nightingale\nRather than the lewd cuckoo sing.\n\nAnd then I thought, anon* it was day,                          *whenever\nI would go somewhere to assay\nIf that I might a nightingale hear;\nFor yet had I none heard of all that year,\nAnd it was then the thirde night of May.\n\nAnd anon as I the day espied,\nNo longer would I in my bed abide;\nBut to a wood that was fast by,\nI went forth alone boldely,\nAnd held the way down by a brooke's side,\n\nTill I came to a laund* of white and green,                        *lawn\nSo fair a one had I never in been;\nThe ground was green, *y-powder'd with daisy,*     *strewn with daisies*\nThe flowers and the *greves like high,*      *bushes of the same height*\nAll green and white; was nothing elles seen.\n\nThere sat I down among the faire flow'rs,\nAnd saw the birdes trip out of their bow'rs,\nThere as they rested them alle the night;\nThey were so joyful of the daye's light,\nThey began of May for to do honours.\n\nThey coud* that service all by rote;                               *knew\nThere was many a lovely note!\nSome sange loud as they had plain'd,\nAnd some in other manner voice feign'd,\nAnd some all out with the full throat.\n\nThey proined* them, and made them right gay,     *preened their feathers\nAnd danc'd and leapt upon the spray;\nAnd evermore two and two in fere,*                             *together\nRight so as they had chosen them to-year*                     *this year\nIn Feverere* upon Saint Valentine's Day.                       *February\n\nAnd the river that I sat upon,*                                  *beside\nIt made such a noise as it ran,\nAccordant* with the birde's harmony,                  *keeping time with\nMe thought it was the beste melody\nThat might be heard of any man.\n\nAnd for delight, I wote never how,\nI fell in such a slumber and a swow, --                           *swoon\nNot all asleep, nor fully waking, --\nAnd in that swow me thought I hearde sing\nThe sorry bird, the lewd cuckow;\n\nAnd that was on a tree right faste by.\nBut who was then *evil apaid* but I?                       *dissatisfied\n\"Now God,\" quoth I, \"that died on the crois,*                     *cross\nGive sorrow on thee, and on thy lewed voice!\nFull little joy have I now of thy cry.\"\n\nAnd as I with the cuckoo thus gan chide,\nI heard, in the next bush beside,\nA nightingale so lustily sing,\nThat her clear voice she made ring\nThrough all the greenwood wide.\n\n\"Ah, good Nightingale,\" quoth I then,\n\"A little hast thou been too long hen;*                   *hence, absent\nFor here hath been the lewd cuckow,\nAnd sung songs rather* than hast thou:                           *sooner\nI pray to God that evil fire her bren!\"*

A stronger reading is \"all.\"\n\n3. \"Ocy, ocy,\" is supposed to come from the Latin \"occidere,\"\nto kill; or rather the old French, \"occire,\" \"occis,\" denoting the\ndoom which the nightingale imprecates or supplicates on all\nwho do offence to Love.\n\n4.

The Queen: Philippa of Hainault, wife of Edward III.\n\n\n\n                     THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS.\n\n\n[In \"The Assembly of Fowls\" -- which Chaucer's \"Retractation\"\ndescribes as \"The Book of Saint Valentine's Day, or of the\nParliament of Birds\" -- we are presented with a picture of the\nmediaeval \"Court of Love\" far closer to the reality than we find\nin Chaucer's poem which bears that express title. We have a\nregularly constituted conclave or tribunal, under a president\nwhose decisions are final. A difficult question is proposed for\nthe consideration and judgment of the Court -- the disputants\nadvancing and vindicating their claims in person. The attendants\nupon the Court, through specially chosen mouthpieces, deliver\ntheir opinions on the cause; and finally a decision is\nauthoritatively pronounced by the president -- which, as in\nmany of the cases actually judged before the Courts of Love in\nFrance, places the reasonable and modest wish of a sensitive\nand chaste lady above all the eagerness of her lovers, all the\nincongruous counsels of representative courtiers. So far,\ntherefore, as the poem reproduces the characteristic features of\nprocedure in those romantic Middle Age halls of amatory\njustice, Chaucer's \"Assembly of Fowls\" is his real \"Court of\nLove;\" for although, in the castle and among the courtiers of\nAdmetus and Alcestis, we have all the personages and\nmachinery necessary for one of those erotic contentions, in the\npresent poem we see the personages and the machinery actually\nat work, upon another scene and under other guises. The\nallegory which makes the contention arise out of the loves, and\nproceed in the assembly, of the feathered race, is quite in\nkeeping with the fanciful yet nature-loving spirit of the poetry\nof Chaucer's time, in which the influence of the Troubadours\nwas still largely present. It is quite in keeping, also, with the\nprinciples that regulated the Courts, the purpose of which was\nmore to discuss and determine the proper conduct of love\naffairs, than to secure conviction or acquittal, sanction or\nreprobation, in particular cases -- though the jurisdiction and\nthe judgments of such assemblies often closely concerned\nindividuals. Chaucer introduces us to his main theme through\nthe vestibule of a fancied dream -- a method which be\nrepeatedly employs with great relish, as for instance in \"The\nHouse of Fame.\" He has spent the whole day over Cicero's\naccount of the Dream of Scipio (Africanus the Younger); and,\nhaving gone to bed, he dreams that Africanus the Elder appears\nto him -- just as in the book he appeared to his namesake -- and\ncarries him into a beautiful park, in which is a fair garden by a\nriver-side. Here the poet is led into a splendid temple, through a\ncrowd of courtiers allegorically representing the various\ninstruments, pleasures, emotions, and encouragements of Love;\nand in the temple Venus herself is found, sporting with her\nporter Richess. Returning into the garden, he sees the Goddess\nof Nature seated on a hill of flowers; and before her are\nassembled all the birds -- for it is Saint Valentine's Day, when\nevery fowl chooses her mate. Having with a graphic touch\nenumerated and described the principal birds, the poet sees that\non her hand Nature bears a female eagle of surpassing loveliness\nand virtue, for which three male eagles advance contending\nclaims. The disputation lasts all day; and at evening the\nassembled birds, eager to be gone with their mates, clamour for\na decision. The tercelet, the goose, the cuckoo, and the turtle --\nfor birds of prey, water-fowl, worm-fowl, and seed-fowl\nrespectively -- pronounce their verdicts on the dispute, in\nspeeches full of character and humour; but Nature refers the\ndecision between the three claimants to the female eagle herself,\nwho prays that she may have a year's respite. Nature grants the\nprayer, pronounces judgment accordingly, and dismisses the\nassembly; and after a chosen choir has sung a roundel in honour\nof the Goddess, all the birds fly away, and the poet awakes. It is\nprobable that Chaucer derived the idea of the poem from a\nFrench source; Mr Bell gives the outline of a fabliau, of which\nthree versions existed, and in which a contention between two\nladies regarding the merits of their respective lovers, a knight\nand a clerk, is decided by Cupid in a Court composed of birds,\nwhich assume their sides according to their different natures.\nWhatever the source of the idea, its management, and the whole\nworkmanship of the poem, especially in the more humorous\npassages, are essentially Chaucer's own.]\n\n\nTHE life so short, the craft so long to learn,\nTh'assay so hard, so sharp the conquering,\nThe dreadful joy, alway that *flits so yern;*           *fleets so fast*\nAll this mean I by* Love, that my feeling             *with reference to\nAstoneth* with his wonderful working,                            *amazes\nSo sore, y-wis, that, when I on him think,\nNaught wit I well whether I fleet* or sink,                       *float\n\nFor *all be* that I know not Love indeed,             *albeit, although*\nNor wot how that he *quiteth folk their hire,*         *rewards folk for\nYet happeth me full oft in books to read                  their service*\nOf his miracles, and of his cruel ire;\nThere read I well, he will be lord and sire;\nI dare not saye, that his strokes be sore;\nBut God save such a lord!

Scipio\nAfricanus Minor is represented as relating a dream which he had\nwhen, in B.C. 149, he went to Africa as military tribune to the\nfourth legion. He had talked long and earnestly of his adoptive\ngrandfather with Massinissa, King of Numidia, the intimate\nfriend of the great Scipio; and at night his illustrious ancestor\nappeared to him in a vision, foretold the overthrow of Carthage\nand all his other triumphs, exhorted him to virtue and patriotism\nby the assurance of rewards in the next world, and discoursed\nto him concerning the future state and the immortality of the\nsoul. Macrobius, about AD. 500, wrote a Commentary upon the\n\"Somnium Scipionis,\" which was a favourite book in the Middle\nAges. See note 17 to The Nun's Priest's Tale.\n\n2. Y-nome: taken; past participle of \"nime,\" from Anglo-Saxon,\n\"niman,\" to take.\n\n3. His grace: the favour which the gods would show him, in\ndelivering Carthage into his hands.\n\n4. \"Vestra vero, quae dicitur, vita mors est.\" (\"Truly, as is said,\nyour life is a death\")\n\n5. The nine spheres are God, or the highest heaven, constraining\nand containing all the others; the Earth, around which the\nplanets and the highest heaven revolve; and the seven planets:\nthe revolution of all producing the \"music of the spheres.\"\n\n6. Clear: illustrious, noble; Latin, \"clarus.\"\n\n7. The sicke mette he drinketh of the tun: The sick man dreams\nthat he drinks wine, as one in health.\n\n8. The significance of the poet's looking to the NNW is not\nplain; his window may have faced that way.\n\n9. The idea of the twin gates, leading to the Paradise and the\nHell of lovers, may have been taken from the description of the\ngates of dreams in the Odyssey and the Aeneid; but the iteration\nof \"Through me men go\" far more directly suggests the legend\non Dante's gate of Hell:--\n\nPer me si va nella citta dolente,\nPer me si va nell' eterno dolore;\nPer me si va tra la perduta gente.\n\n(\"Through me is the way to the city of sorrow,\nThrough me is the way to eternal suffering;\nThrough me is the way of the lost people\")\n\nThe famous line, \"Lasciate ogni speranza, voi che entrate\" --\n\"All hope abandon, ye who enter here\" -- is evidently\nparaphrased in Chaucer's words \"Th'eschewing is the only\nremedy;\" that is, the sole hope consists in the avoidance of that\ndismal gate.\n\n10. A powerful though homely description of torment; the\nsufferers being represented as fish enclosed in a weir from\nwhich all the water has been withdrawn.\n\n11. Compare with this catalogue raisonne of trees the ampler\nlist given by Spenser in \"The Faerie Queen,\" book i. canto i. In\nseveral instances, as in \"the builder oak\" and \"the sailing pine,\"\nthe later poet has exactly copied the words of the earlier.\nThe builder oak: In the Middle Ages the oak was as\ndistinctively the building timber on land, as it subsequently\nbecame for the sea.\nThe pillar elm:  Spenser explains this in paraphrasing it into \"the\nvineprop elm\" -- because it was planted as a pillar or  prop to\nthe vine; it is called \"the coffer unto carrain,\" or \"carrion,\"\nbecause coffins for the dead were made from it.\nThe box, pipe tree: the box tree was used for making pipes or horns.\nHolm: the holly, used for whip-handles.\nThe sailing fir: Because ships' masts and spars were made of its\nwood.\nThe cypress death to plain: in Spenser's imitation, \"the cypress\nfuneral.\"\nThe shooter yew: yew wood was used for bows.\nThe aspe for shaftes plain: of the aspen, or black poplar, arrows\nwere made.\nThe laurel divine: So called, either because it was Apollo's\ntree -- Horace says that Pindar is \"laurea donandus Apollinari\" (\"to\nbe given Apollo's laurel\") -- or because the honour which it\nsignified, when placed on the head of a poet or conqueror, lifted\na man as it were into the rank of the gods.\n\n12. If Chaucer had any special trio of courtiers in his mind when\nhe excluded so many names, we may suppose them to be\nCharms, Sorcery, and Leasings who, in The Knight's Tale, come\nafter Bawdry and Riches -- to whom Messagerie (the carrying\nof messages) and Meed (reward, bribe) may correspond.\n\n13. The dove was the bird sacred to Venus; hence Ovid\nenumerates the peacock of Juno, Jove's armour bearing bird,\n\"Cythereiadasque columbas\" (\"And the Cythereian doves\") --\n\"Metamorphoses. xv. 386\n\n14. Priapus:  fitly endowed with a place in the Temple of Love,\nas being the embodiment of the principle of fertility in flocks\nand the fruits of the earth. See note 23 to the Merchant's Tale.\n\n15. Ovid, in the \"Fasti\" (i. 433), describes the confusion of\nPriapus when, in the night following a feast of sylvan and\nBacchic deities, the braying of the ass of Silenus wakened the\ncompany to detect the god in a furtive amatory expedition.\n\n16. Hautain: haughty, lofty; French, \"hautain.\"\n\n17. Well to my pay: Well to my satisfaction; from French,\n\"payer,\" to pay, satisfy; the same word often occurs, in the\nphrases \"well apaid,\" and \"evil apaid.\"\n\n18. Valentia, in Spain, was famed for the fabrication of fine and\ntransparent stuffs.\n\n19. The obvious reference is to the proverbial \"Sine Cerere et\nLibero friget Venus,\" (\"Love is frozen without freedom and\nfood\") quoted in Terence, \"Eunuchus,\" act iv. scene v.\n\n20. Cypride: Venus; called \"Cypria,\" or \"Cypris,\" from the\nisland of Cyprus, in which her worship was especially\ncelebrated.\n\n21. Callisto, daughter of Lycaon, was seduced by Jupiter,\nturned into a bear by Diana, and placed afterwards, with her\nson, as the Great Bear among the stars.\nAtalanta challenged Hippomenes, a Boetian youth, to a race in\nwhich the prize was her hand in marriage -- the penalty of\nfailure, death by her hand. Venus gave Hippomenes three\ngolden apples, and he won by dropping them one at a time\nbecause Atalanta stopped to pick them up.\nSemiramis was Queen of Ninus, the mythical founder of\nBabylon; Ovid mentions her, along with Lais, as a type of\nvoluptuousness, in his \"Amores,\" 1.5, 11.\nCanace, daughter of Aeolus, is named in the prologue to The\nMan of Law's Tale as one of the ladies whose \"cursed stories\"\nChaucer refrained from writing. She loved her brother\nMacareus, and was slain by her father.\nHercules was conquered by his love for Omphale, and spun\nwool for her in a woman's dress, while she wore his lion's skin.\nBiblis vainly pursued her brother Caunus with her love, till she\nwas changed to a fountain; Ovid, \"Metamorphoses.\" lib. ix.\nThisbe and Pyramus: the Babylonian lovers, whose death,\nthrough the error of Pyramus in fancying that a lion had slain his\nmistress, forms the theme of the interlude in the \"Midsummer\nNight's Dream.\"\nSir Tristram was one of the most famous among the knights of\nKing Arthur, and La Belle Isoude was his mistress. Their story\nis mixed up with the Arthurian romance; but it was also the\nsubject of separate treatment, being among the most popular of\nthe Middle Age legends.\nAchilles is reckoned among Love's conquests, because,\naccording to some traditions, he loved Polyxena, the daughter\nof Priam, who was promised to him if he consented to join the\nTrojans; and, going without arms into Apollo's temple at\nThymbra, he was there slain by Paris.\nScylla: Love-stories are told of two maidens of this name; one\nthe daughter of Nisus, King of Megara, who, falling in love with\nMinos when he besieged the city, slew  her father by pulling\nout the golden hair which grew on the top of his head, and on\nwhich  which his life and kingdom depended. Minos won the\ncity, but rejected her love in horror. The other Scylla, from\nwhom the rock opposite Charybdis was named, was a beautiful\nmaiden, beloved by the sea-god Glaucus, but changed into a\nmonster through the jealousy and enchantments of Circe.\nThe mother of Romulus:  Silvia, daughter and only living child\nof Numitor, whom her uncle Amulius made a vestal virgin, to\npreclude the possibility that his brother's descendants could\nwrest from him the kingdom of Alba Longa. But the maiden\nwas violated by Mars as she went to bring water from a\nfountain; she bore Romulus and Remus; and she was drowned\nin the Anio, while the cradle with the children was carried down\nthe stream in safety to the Palatine Hill, where the she-wolf\nadopted them.\n\n22.

The falcon was borne on the hand by the highest\npersonages, not merely in actual sport, but to be caressed and\npetted, even on occasions of ceremony, Hence also it is called\nthe \"gentle\" falcon -- as if its high birth and breeding gave it a\nright to august society.\n\n25. The merlion: elsewhere in the same poem called \"emerlon;\"\nFrench, \"emerillon;\" the merlin, a small hawk carried by ladies.\n\n26.

The false lapwing: full of stratagems and pretences to divert\napproaching danger from the nest where her young ones are.\n\n28. The sparrow, Venus' son: Because sacred to Venus.\n\n29. Coming with the spring, the nightingale is charmingly said\nto call forth the new leaves.\n\n30. Many- wings, like those of peacocks, were often\ngiven to angels in paintings of the Middle Ages; and in\naccordance with this fashion Spenser represents the Angel that\nguarded Sir Guyon (\"Faerie Queen,\" book ii. canto vii.) as\nhaving wings \"decked with diverse plumes, like painted jay's.\"\n\n31. The pheasant, scorner of the cock by night:  The meaning of\nthis passage is not very plain; it has been supposed, however, to\nrefer to the frequent breeding of pheasants at night with\ndomestic poultry in the farmyard -- thus scorning the sway of\nthe cock, its rightful monarch.\n\n32. The waker goose:  Chaucer evidently alludes to the passage\nin Ovid describing the crow of Apollo, which rivalled the\nspotless doves, \"Nec servataris vigili Capitolia voce cederet\nanseribus\" -- \"nor would it yield (in whiteness) to the geese\ndestined with wakeful or vigilant voice to save the Capitol\"\n(\"Metam.,\" ii. 538) when about to be surprised by the Gauls in\na night attack.\n\n33. The cuckoo ever unkind: the significance of this epithet is\namply explained by the poem of \"The Cuckoo and the\nNightingale.\"\n\n34. The drake, destroyer: of the ducklings -- which, if not\nprevented, he will kill wholesale.\n\n35. The stork is conspicuous for faithfulness to all family\nobligations, devotion to its young, and care of its parent birds in\ntheir old age. Mr Bell quotes from Bishop Stanley's \"History of\nBirds\" a little story which peculiarly justifies the special\ncharacter Chaucer has given: --  \"A French surgeon, at Smyrna,\nwishing to procure a stork, and finding great difficulty, on\naccount of the extreme veneration in which they are held by the\nTurks, stole all the eggs out of a nest, and replaced them with\nthose of a hen: in process of time the young chickens came\nforth, much to the astonishment of Mr and Mrs Stork. In a\nshort time Mr S. went off, and was not seen for two or three\ndays, when he returned with an immense crowd of his\ncompanions, who all assembled in the place, and formed a\ncircle, taking no notice of the numerous spectators whom so\nunusual an occurrence had collected. Mrs Stork was brought\nforward into the midst of the circle, and, after some\nconsultation, the whole flock fell upon her and tore her to\npieces; after which they immediately dispersed, and the nest was\nentirely abandoned.\"\n\n36. The cormorant feeds upon fish, so voraciously, that when\nthe stomach is crammed it will often have the gullet and bill\nlikewise full, awaiting the digestion of the rest.\n\n37. So called from the evil omens supposed to be afforded by\ntheir harsh cries.\n\n38. The fieldfare visits this country only in hard wintry weather.\n\n39. \"Formel,\" strictly or originally applied to the female of the\neagle and hawk, is here used generally of the female of all birds;\n\"tercel\" is the corresponding word applied to the male.\n\n40. Entriketh: entangles, ensnares; french, \"intriguer,\" to\nperplex; hence \"intricate.\"\n\n41. Entremette him of: meddle with; French, ' entremettre,\" to\ninterfere.\n\n42. The duck exhorts the contending lovers to be of light heart\nand sing, for abundance of other ladies were at their command.\n\n43. Solain: single, alone; the same word originally as \"sullen.\"\n\n44. The cuckoo is distinguished by its habit of laying its eggs in\nthe nests of other and smaller birds, such as the hedge-sparrow\n(\"heggsugg\"); and its young, when hatched, throw the eggs or\nnestlings of the true parent bird out of the nest, thus engrossing\nthe mother's entire care. The crime on which the emerlon\ncomments so sharply, is explained by the migratory habits of the\ncuckoo, which prevent its bringing up its own young; and\nnature has provided facilities for the crime, by furnishing the\nyoung bird with a peculiarly strong and broad back, indented by\na hollow in which the sparrow's egg is lifted till it is thrown out\nof the nest.\n\n45. \"Who well loves, late forgets;\" the refrain of the roundel\ninculcates the duty of constancy, which has been imposed on\nthe three tercels by the decision of the Court.\n\n\n\n                     THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF\n\n\n[\"The Flower and the Leaf\" is pre-eminently one of those\npoems by which Chaucer may be triumphantly defended against\nthe charge of licentious coarseness, that, founded upon his\nfaithful representation of the manners, customs, and daily life\nand speech of his own time, in \"The Canterbury Tales,\" are\nsweepingly advanced against his works at large. In an allegory --\nrendered perhaps somewhat cumbrous by the detail of chivalric\nceremonial, and the heraldic minuteness, which entered so liberally\ninto poetry, as into the daily life of the classes for whom poetry\nwas then written -- Chaucer beautifully enforces the lasting\nadvantages of purity, valour, and faithful love, and the fleeting\nand disappointing character of mere idle pleasure, of sloth\nand listless retirement from the battle of life. In the\n\"season sweet\" of spring, which the great singer of Middle Age\nEngland loved so well, a gentle woman is supposed to seek\nsleep in vain, to rise \"about the springing of the gladsome day,\"\nand, by an unfrequented path in a pleasant grove, to arrive at an\narbour. Beside the arbour stands a medlar-tree, in which a\nGoldfinch sings passing sweetly; and the Nightingale answers\nfrom a green laurel tree, with so merry and ravishing a note,\nthat the lady resolves to proceed no farther, but sit down on the\ngrass to listen. Suddenly the sound of many voices singing\nsurprises her; and she sees \"a world of ladies\" emerge from a\ngrove, clad in white, and wearing garlands of laurel, of agnus\ncastus, and woodbind. One, who wears a crown and bears a\nbranch of agnus castus in her hand, begins a roundel, in honour\nof the Leaf, which all the others take up, dancing and singing in\nthe meadow before the arbour. Soon, to the sound of\nthundering trumps, and attended by a splendid and warlike\nretinue, enter nine knights, in white, crowned like the ladies;\nand after they have jousted an hour and more, they alight and\nadvance to the ladies. Each dame takes a knight by the hand;\nand all incline reverently to the laurel tree, which they\nencompass, singing of love, and dancing. Soon, preceded by a\nband of minstrels, out of the open field comes a lusty company\nof knights and ladies in green, crowned with chaplets of\nflowers; and they do reverence to a tuft of flowers in the middle\nof the meadow, while one of their number sings a bergerette in\npraise of the daisy. But now it is high noon; the sun waxes\nfervently hot; the flowers lose their beauty, and wither with the\nheat; the ladies in green are scorched, the knights faint for lack\nof shade. Then a strong wind beats down all the flowers, save\nsuch as are protected by the leaves of hedges and groves; and a\nmighty storm of rain and hail drenches the ladies and knights,\nshelterless in the now flowerless meadow. The storm overpast,\nthe company in white, whom the laurel-tree has safely shielded\nfrom heat and storm, advance to the relief of the others; and\nwhen their clothes have been dried, and their wounds from sun\nand storm healed, all go together to sup with the Queen in\nwhite -- on whose hand, as they pass by the arbour, the\nNightingale perches, while the Goldfinch flies to the Lady of the\nFlower. The pageant gone, the gentlewoman quits the arbour,\nand meets a lady in white, who, at her request, unfolds the\nhidden meaning of all that she has seen; \"which,\" says Speght\nquaintly, \"is this: They which honour the Flower, a thing fading\nwith every blast, are such as look after beauty and worldly\npleasure. But they that honour the Leaf, which abideth with the\nroot, notwithstanding the frosts and winter storms, are they\nwhich follow Virtue and during qualities, without regard of\nworldly respects.\" Mr Bell, in his edition, has properly noticed\nthat there is no explanation of the emblematical import of the\nmedlar-tree, the goldfinch, and the nightingale. \"But,\" he says,\n\"as the fruit of the medlar, to use Chaucer's own expression (see\nPrologue to the Reeve's Tale), is rotten before it is ripe, it may\nbe the emblem of sensual pleasure, which palls before it confers\nreal enjoyment. The goldfinch is remarkable for the beauty of its\nplumage, the sprightliness of its movements, and its gay,\ntinkling song, and may be supposed to represent the showy and\nunsubstantial character of frivolous pleasures. The nightingale's\nsober outward appearance and impassioned song denote greater\ndepth of feeling.\" The poem throughout is marked by the purest\nand loftiest moral tone; and it amply deserved Dryden's special\nrecommendation, \"both for the invention and the moral.\" It is\ngiven without abridgement.]\n(Transcriber's note: Modern scholars believe that Chaucer was\nnot the author of this poem)\n\nWHEN that Phoebus his car of gold so high\nHad whirled up the starry sky aloft,\nAnd in the Bull <1> enter'd certainly;\nWhen showers sweet of rain descended soft,\nCausing the grounde, fele* times and oft,                          *many\nUp for to give many a wholesome air,\nAnd every plain was y-clothed fair\n\nWith newe green, and maketh smalle flow'rs\nTo springe here and there in field and mead;\nSo very good and wholesome be the show'rs,\nThat they renewe what was old and dead\nIn winter time;

and an eight foot or nine\nEvery tree well from his fellow grew,\nWith branches broad, laden with leaves new,\nThat sprangen out against the sunne sheen;\nSome very red;<2> and some a glad light green;\n\nWhich, as me thought, was right a pleasant sight.\nAnd eke the birdes' songes for to hear\nWould have rejoiced any earthly wight;\nAnd I, that could not yet, in no mannere,\nHeare the nightingale of* all the year,<3>                       *during\nFull busy hearkened with heart and ear,\nIf I her voice perceive could anywhere.\n\nAnd at the last a path of little brede*                         *breadth\nI found, that greatly had not used be;\nFor it forgrowen* was with grass and weed,                    *overgrown\nThat well unneth* a wight mighte see:                          *scarcely\nThought I, \"This path some whither goes, pardie!\"*          *of a surety\nAnd so I follow'd [it], till it me brought\nTo a right pleasant arbour, well y-wrought,\n\nThat benched  was, and [all] with turfes new\nFreshly y-turf'd, <4> whereof the greene grass,\nSo small, so thick, so short, so fresh of hue,\nThat most like to green wool, I wot, it was;\nThe hedge also, that *yeden in compass,*           *went all around <5>*\nAnd closed in all the greene herbere,*                           *arbour\nWith sycamore was set and eglatere,*             *eglantine, sweet-briar\n\nWreathed *in fere* so well and cunningly,                     *together*\nThat ev'ry branch and leaf grew *by measure,*                *regularly*\nPlain as a board, of *a height by and by:*         *the same height side\nI saw never a thing, I you ensure,                              by side*\nSo well y-done; for he that took the cure*                  *pains, care\nTo maken it, I trow did all his pain\nTo make it pass all those that men have seen.\n\nAnd shapen was this arbour, roof and all,\nAs is a pretty parlour; and also\nThe hedge as thick was as a castle wall,\nThat whoso list without to stand or go,\nThough he would all day pryen to and fro,\nHe should not see if there were any wight\nWithin or no; but one within well might\n\nPerceive all those that wente there without\nInto the field, that was on ev'ry side\nCover'd with corn and grass; that out of doubt,\nThough one would seeken all the worlde wide,\nSo rich a fielde could not be espied\nUpon no coast, *as of the quantity;*                  *for its abundance\nFor of all goode thing there was plenty.                   or fertility*\n\nAnd I, that all this pleasant sight [did] see,\nThought suddenly I felt so sweet an air\nOf the eglentere, that certainly\nThere is no heart, I deem, in such despair,\nNor yet with thoughtes froward and contrair\nSo overlaid, but it should soon have boot,*             *remedy, relief*\nIf it had ones felt this *savour swoot.*                   *sweet smell*\n\nAnd as I stood, and cast aside mine eye,\nI was ware of the fairest medlar tree\nThat ever yet in all my life I seye,*                               *saw\nAs full of blossoms as it mighte be;\nTherein a goldfinch leaping prettily\nFrom bough to bough; and as him list he eat\nHere and there of the buds and flowers sweet.\n\nAnd to the arbour side was adjoining\nThis fairest tree, of which I have you told;\nAnd at the last the bird began to sing\n(When he had eaten what he eate wo'ld)\nSo passing sweetly, that by many fold\nIt was more pleasant than I could devise;*               *tell, describe\nAnd, when his song was ended in this wise,\n\nThe nightingale with so merry a note\nAnswered him, that all the woode rung,\nSo suddenly, that, *as it were a sote,*                *like a fool <6>*\nI stood astound'; so was I with the song\nThorough ravished, that, *till late and long,*         *for a long time*\nI wist not in what place I was, nor where;\nAgain, me thought, she sung e'en by mine ear.\n\nWherefore I waited about busily\nOn ev'ry side, if that I might her see;\nAnd at the last I gan full well espy\nWhere she sat in a fresh green laurel tree,\nOn the further side, even right by me,\nThat gave so passing a delicious smell,\n*According to* the eglantere full well.                  *blending with*\n\nWhereof I had so inly great pleasure,\nThat, as me thought, I surely ravish'd was\nInto Paradise, where [as] my desire\nWas for to be, and no farther to pass,\nAs for that day; and on the sweete grass\nI sat me down; for, *as for mine intent,*                   *to my mind*\nThe birde's song was more *convenient,*       *appropriate to my humour*\n\nAnd more pleasant to me, by many fold,\nThan meat, or drink, or any other thing;\nThereto the arbour was so fresh and cold,\nThe wholesome savours eke so comforting,\nThat, as I deemed, since the beginning\nOf the world was [there] never seen *ere than*             *before then*\nSo pleasant a ground of none earthly man.\n\nAnd as I sat, the birdes heark'ning thus,\nMe thought that I heard voices suddenly,\nThe most sweetest and most delicious\nThat ever any wight, I *trow truely,*                   *verily believe*\nHeard in their life; for the harmony\nAnd sweet accord was in so good musike,\nThat the voices to angels' most were like.\n\nAt the last, out of a grove even by,\nThat was right goodly, and pleasant to sight,\nI saw where there came, singing lustily,\nA world of ladies; but to tell aright\nTheir greate beauty, lies not in my might,\nNor their array; nevertheless I shall\nTell you a part, though I speak not of all.\n\nIn surcoats* white, of velvet well fitting,                 *upper robes\nThey were clad, and the seames each one,\nAs it were a mannere [of] garnishing,\nWas set with emeraldes, one and one,\n*By and by;* but many a riche stone                           *in a row*\nWas set upon the purfles,* out of doubt,              *embroidered edges\nOf collars, sleeves, and traines round about;\n\nAs greate pearles, round and orient,*                         *brilliant\nAnd diamondes fine, and rubies red,\nAnd many another stone, of which I went*                  *cannot recall\nThe names now;

The Bull: the sign of Taurus, which the sun enters\nin May.\n\n2. The young oak leaves are red or ashen .\n\n3. Chaucer here again refers to the superstition,\nnoticed in \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale,\" that it\nwas of good omen to hear the nightingale before the\ncuckoo upon the advent of both with spring.\n\n4. The arbour was furnished with seats, which had\nbeen newly covered with turf.\n\n5. \"Yede\" or \"yead,\" is the old form of go.\n\n6. Sote: fool -- French \"sot.\"\n\n7. See note 59 to The Court of Love\n\n8. Agnus castus:  the chaste-tree; a kind of willow.\n\n9. Roundell:  French, \"rondeau;\" a song that comes\nround again to the verse with which it opened, or that\nis taken up in turn by each of the singers.\n\n10.  In modern French form, \"Sous la feuille, devers\nmoi, son et mon joli coeur est endormi\" -- \"Under the\nfoliage, towards me, his and my jolly heart is gone to\nsleep.\"\n\n11. Prester John: The half-mythical Eastern potentate,\nwho is now supposed to have been, not a Christian\nmonarch of Abyssinia, but the head of the Indian\nempire before Zenghis Khan's conquest.\n\n12.

Bargaret: bergerette, or pastoral song.\n\n15. \"Si douce est la margarete.\": \"So sweet is the\ndaisy\" (\"la marguerite\").\n\n16. To make their joustes:  the meaning is not very\nobvious; but in The Knight's Tale \"jousts and array\"\nare in some editions made part of the adornment of\nthe Temple of Venus; and as the word \"jousts\" would\nthere carry the general meaning of \"preparations\" to\nentertain or please a lover, in the present case it may\nhave a similar force.\n\n17. Gramercy:  \"grand merci,\" French; great thanks.\n\n18. The Nine Worthies, who at our day survive in the\nSeven Champions of Christendom. The Worthies\nwere favourite subjects for representation at popular\nfestivals or in masquerades.\n\n19. The famous Knights of King Arthur, who, being\nall esteemed equal in valour and noble qualities, sat at\na round table, so that none should seem to have\nprecedence over the rest.\n\n20.

Laurer: laurel-tree; French, \"laurier.\"\n\n23.  The meaning is: \"Witness the practice of Rome,\nthat was the founder of all knighthood and marvellous\ndeeds; and I refer for corroboration to Titus Livius\"  --\nwho, in several passages, has mentioned the laurel\ncrown as the highest military honour. For instance, in\n1. vii. c. 13, Sextus Tullius, remonstrating for the\narmy against the inaction in which it is kept, tells the\nDictator Sulpicius, \"Duce te vincere cupimus; tibi\nlauream insignem deferre; tecum triumphantes urbem\ninire.\" (\"Commander, we want you to conquer; to\nbring you the laurel insignia; to enter the city with you\nin triumph\")\n\n24.

The octosyllabic measure in which it is written -- the\nsame which the author of \"Hudibras\" used with such admirable\neffect -- is excellently adapted for the vivid descriptions, the\nlively sallies of humour and sarcasm, with which the poem\nabounds; and when the poet actually does get to his subject, he\ntreats it with a zest, and a corresponding interest on the part of\nthe reader, which are scarcely surpassed by the best of The\nCanterbury Tales. The poet, however, tarries long on the way\nto the House of Fame; as Pope says in his advertisement, the\nreader who would compare his with Chaucer's poem, \"may\nbegin with [Chaucer's] third Book of Fame, there being nothing\nin the two first books that answers to their title.\" The first book\nopens with a kind of prologue (actually so marked and called in\nearlier editions) in which the author speculates on the causes of\ndreams; avers that never any man had such a dream as he had\non the tenth of December; and prays the God of Sleep to help\nhim to interpret the dream, and the Mover of all things to\nreward or afflict those readers who take the dream well or ill.\nThen he relates that, having fallen asleep, he fancied himself\nwithin a temple of glass -- the abode of Venus -- the walls of\nwhich were painted with the story of Aeneas. The paintings are\ndescribed at length; and then the poet tells us that, coming out\nof the temple, he found himself on a vast sandy plain, and saw\nhigh in heaven an eagle, that began to descend towards him.\nWith the prologue, the first book numbers 508 lines; of which\n192 only -- more than are actually concerned with or directly\nlead towards the real subject of the poem -- are given here. The\nsecond book, containing 582 lines, of which 176 will be found\nin this edition, is wholly devoted to the voyage from the Temple\nof Venus to the House of Fame, which the dreamer\naccomplishes in the eagle's claws. The bird has been sent by\nJove to do the poet some \"solace\" in reward of his labours for\nthe cause of Love; and during the transit through the air the\nmessenger discourses obligingly and learnedly with his human\nburden on the theory of sound, by which all that is spoken must\nneeds reach the House of Fame; and on other matters suggested\nby their errand and their observations by the way. The third\nbook (of 1080 lines, only a score of which, just at the outset,\nhave been omitted) brings us to the real pith of the poem. It\nfinds the poet close to the House of Fame, built on a rock of ice\nengraved with names, many of which are half-melted away.\nEntering the gorgeous palace, he finds all manner of minstrels\nand historians; harpers, pipers, and trumpeters of fame;\nmagicians, jugglers, sorcerers, and many others. On a throne of\nruby sits the goddess, seeming at one moment of but a cubit's\nstature, at the next touching heaven; and at either hand, on\npillars, stand the great authors who \"bear up the name\" of\nancient nations. Crowds of people enter the hall from all regions\nof earth, praying the goddess to give them good or evil fame,\nwith and without their own deserts; and they receive answers\nfavourable, negative, or contrary, according to the caprice of\nFame. Pursuing his researches further, out of the region of\nreputation or fame proper into that of tidings or rumours, the\npoet is led, by a man who has entered into conversation with\nhim, to a vast whirling house of twigs, ever open to the arrival\nof tidings, ever full of murmurings, whisperings, and clatterings,\ncoming from the vast crowds that fill it -- for every rumour,\nevery piece of news, every false report, appears there in the\nshape of the person who utters it, or passes it on, down in earth.\nOut at the windows innumerable, the tidings pass to Fame, who\ngives to each report its name and duration; and in the house\ntravellers, pilgrims, pardoners, couriers, lovers, &c., make a\nhuge clamour. But here the poet meets with a man \"of great\nauthority,\" and, half afraid, awakes; skilfully  -- whether by\nintention, fatigue, or accident -- leaving the reader disappointed\nby the nonfulfilment of what seemed to be promises of further\ndisclosures. The poem, not least in the passages the omission of\nwhich has been dictated by the exigencies of the present\nvolume, is full of testimony to the vast acquaintance of Chaucer\nwith learning ancient and modern; Ovid, Virgil, Statius, are\nequally at his command to illustrate his narrative or to furnish\nthe ground-work of his descriptions; while architecture, the\nArabic numeration, the theory of sound, and the effects of\ngunpowder, are only a few among the topics of his own time of\nwhich the poet treats with the ease of proficient knowledge.\nNot least interesting are the vivid touches in which Chaucer\nsketches the routine of his laborious and almost recluse daily\nlife; while the strength, individuality, and humour that mark the\ndidactic portion of the poem prove that \"The House of Fame\"\nwas one of the poet's riper productions.]\n\n\nGOD turn us ev'ry dream to good!\nFor it is wonder thing, by the Rood,*                         *Cross <1>\nTo my witte, what causeth swevens,*                              *dreams\nEither on morrows or on evens;\nAnd why th'effect followeth of some,\nAnd of some it shall never come;\nWhy this is an avision\nAnd this a revelation;\nWhy this a dream, why that a sweven,\nAnd not to ev'ry man *like even;*                                *alike*\nWhy this a phantom, why these oracles,\nI n'ot;

About three hundred and fifty lines are devoted\nto the description; but they merely embody Virgil's account of\nAeneas' adventures from the destruction of Troy to his arrival in\nItaly; and the only characteristic passage is the following\nreflection, suggested by the death of Dido for her perfidious but\nfate-compelled guest:\n\nLo! how a woman doth amiss,\nTo love him that unknowen is!\nFor, by Christ, lo! thus it fareth,\nIt is not all gold that glareth.*                              *glitters\nFor, all so brook I well my head,\nThere may be under goodlihead*                          *fair appearance\nCover'd many a shrewed* vice;                                    *cursed\nTherefore let no wight be so nice*                              *foolish\nTo take a love only for cheer,*                                   *looks\nOr speech, or for friendly mannere;\nFor this shall ev'ry woman find,\nThat some man, *of his pure kind,*               *by force of his nature\nWill showen outward the fairest,\nTill he have caught that which him lest;*                       *pleases\nAnd then anon will causes find,\nAnd sweare how she is unkind,\nOr false, or privy* double was.                                *secretly\nAll this say I by* Aeneas                             *with reference to\nAnd Dido, and her *nice lest,*                        *foolish pleasure*\nThat loved all too soon a guest;\nTherefore I will say a proverb,\nThat he that fully knows the herb\nMay safely lay it to his eye;\nWithoute dread,* this is no lie.                                  *doubt\n\nWhen the dreamer had seen all the sights in the temple, he\nbecame desirous to know who had worked all those wonders,\nand in what country he was; so he resolved to go out at the\nwicket, in search of somebody who might tell him.\n\nWhen I out at the doores came,\nI fast aboute me beheld;\nThen saw I but a large feld,*                              *open country\nAs far as that I mighte see,\nWIthoute town, or house, or tree,\nOr bush, or grass, or ered* land,                          *ploughed <9>\nFor all the field was but of sand,\nAs small* as men may see it lie                                    *fine\nIn the desert of Libye;\nNor no manner creature\nThat is formed by Nature,\nThere saw I, me to *rede or wiss.*                    *advise or direct*\n\"O Christ!\" thought I, \"that art in bliss,\nFrom *phantom and illusion*                   *vain fancy and deception*\nMe save!\" and with devotion\nMine eyen to the heav'n I cast.\nThen was I ware at the last\nThat, faste by the sun on high,\n*As kennen might I* with mine eye,          *as well as I might discern*\nMe thought I saw an eagle soar,\nBut that it seemed muche more*                                   *larger\nThan I had any eagle seen;\nThis is as sooth as death, certain,\nIt was of gold, and shone so bright,\nThat never saw men such a sight,\nBut if* the heaven had y-won,                                    *unless\nAll new from God, another sun;\nSo shone the eagle's feathers bright:\nAnd somewhat downward gan it light.*                    *descend, alight\n\nThe Second Book opens with a brief invocation of Venus and\nof Thought; then it proceeds:\n\nThis eagle, of which I have you told,\nThat shone with feathers as of gold,\nWhich that so high began to soar,\nI gan beholde more and more,\nTo see her beauty and the wonder;\nBut never was there dint of thunder,\nNor that thing that men calle foudre,*                      *thunderbolt\nThat smote sometimes a town to powder,\nAnd in his swifte coming brenn'd,*                               *burned\nThat so swithe* gan descend,                                    *rapidly\nAs this fowl, when that it beheld\nThat I a-roam was in the feld;\nAnd with his grim pawes strong,\nWithin his sharpe nailes long,\nMe, flying, at a swap* he hent,**                         *swoop *seized\nAnd with his sours <10> again up went,\nMe carrying in his clawes stark*                                 *strong\nAs light as I had been a lark,\nHow high, I cannot telle you,\nFor I came up, I wist not how.\n\nThe poet faints through bewilderment and fear; but the eagle,\nspeaking with the voice of a man, recalls him to himself, and\ncomforts him by the assurance that what now befalls him is for\nhis instruction and profit. Answering the poet's unspoken\ninquiry whether he is not to die otherwise, or whether Jove will\nhim stellify, the eagle says that he has been sent by Jupiter out\nof his \"great ruth,\"\n\n\"For that thou hast so truely\nSo long served ententively*                         *with attentive zeal\nHis blinde nephew* Cupido,                                     *grandson\nAnd faire Venus also,\nWithoute guuerdon ever yet,\nAnd natheless hast set thy wit\n(Although that in thy head full lite* is)                        *little\nTo make bookes, songs, and ditties,\nIn rhyme or elles in cadence,\nAs thou best canst, in reverence\nOf Love, and of his servants eke,\nThat have his service sought, and seek,\nAnd pained thee to praise his art,\nAlthough thou haddest never part; <11>\nWherefore, all so God me bless,\nJovis holds it great humbless,\nAnd virtue eke, that thou wilt make\nA-night full oft thy head to ache,\nIn thy study so thou writest,\nAnd evermore of love enditest,\nIn honour of him and praisings,\nAnd in his folke's furtherings,\nAnd in their matter all devisest,*                              *relates\nAnd not him nor his folk despisest,\nAlthough thou may'st go in the dance\nOf them that him list not advance.\nWherefore, as I said now, y-wis,\nJupiter well considers this;\nAnd also, beausire,* other things;                             *good sir\nThat is, that thou hast no tidings\nOf Love's folk, if they be glad,\nNor of naught elles that God made;\nAnd not only from far country\nThat no tidings come to thee,\nBut of thy very neighebours,\nThat dwellen almost at thy doors,\nThou hearest neither that nor this.\nFor when thy labour all done is,\nAnd hast y-made thy reckonings, <12>\nInstead of rest and newe things,\nThou go'st home to thy house anon,\nAnd, all so dumb as any stone,\nThou sittest at another book,\nTill fully dazed* is thy look;                                  *blinded\nAnd livest thus as a hermite\nAlthough thine abstinence is lite.\"* <13>                        *little\n\nTherefore has Jove appointed the eagle to take the poet to the\nHouse of Fame, to do him some pleasure in recompense for his\ndevotion to Cupid; and he will hear, says the bird,\n\n\"When we be come there as I say,\nMore wondrous thinges, dare I lay,*                                 *bet\nOf Love's folke more tidings,\nBoth *soothe sawes and leasings;*                *true sayings and lies*\nAnd more loves new begun,\nAnd long y-served loves won,\nAnd more loves casually\nThat be betid,* no man knows why,                    *happened by chance\nBut as a blind man starts a hare;\nAnd more jollity and welfare,\nWhile that they finde *love of steel,*              *love true as steel*\nAs thinketh them, and over all weel;\nMore discords, and more jealousies,\nMore murmurs, and more novelties,\nAnd more dissimulations,\nAnd feigned reparations;\nAnd more beardes, in two hours,\nWithoute razor or scissours\nY-made, <14> than graines be of sands;\nAnd eke more holding in hands,*                              *embracings\nAnd also more renovelances*                                   *renewings\nOf old *forleten acquaintances;*          *broken-off acquaintanceships*\nMore love-days,<15> and more accords,*                       *agreements\nThan on instruments be chords;\nAnd eke of love more exchanges\nThan ever cornes were in granges.\"*                               *barns\n\nThe poet can scarcely believe that, though Fame had all the pies\n[magpies] and all the spies in a kingdom, she should hear so\nmuch; but the eagle proceeds to prove that she can.\n\nFirst shalt thou heare where she dwelleth;\nAnd, so as thine own booke telleth, <16>\nHer palace stands, as I shall say,\nRight ev'n in middes of the way\nBetweene heav'n, and earth, and sea,\nThat whatsoe'er in all these three\nIs spoken, *privy or apert,*                        *secretly or openly*\nThe air thereto is so overt,*                                     *clear\nAnd stands eke in so just* a place,                            *suitable\nThat ev'ry sound must to it pace,\nOr whatso comes from any tongue,\nBe it rowned,* read, or sung,                                 *whispered\nOr spoken in surety or dread,*                                    *doubt\nCertain *it must thither need.\"*              *it must needs go thither*\n\nThe eagle, in a long discourse, demonstrates that, as all natural\nthings have a natural place towards which they move by natural\ninclination, and as sound is only broken air, so every sound\nmust come to Fame's House, \"though it were piped of a mouse\"\n-- on the same principle by which every part of a mass of water\nis affected by the casting in of a stone. The poet is all the while\nborne upward, entertained with various information by the bird;\nwhich at last cries out --\n\n\"Hold up thy head, for all is well!\nSaint Julian, lo! bon hostel! <17>\nSee

unshet;*                             *unshut, open\nNor porter there is none to let*                                 *hinder\nNo manner tidings in to pace;\nNor ever rest is in that place,\nThat it n'is* fill'd full of tidings,                            *is not\nEither loud, or of whisperings;\nAnd ever all the house's angles\nAre full of *rownings and of jangles,*     *whisperings and chatterings*\nOf wars, of peace, of marriages,\nOf rests, of labour, of voyages,\nOf abode, of death, of life,\nOf love, of hate, accord, of strife,\nOf loss, of lore, and of winnings,\nOf health, of sickness, of buildings,\nOf faire weather and tempests,\nOf qualm* of folkes and of beasts;                             *sickness\nOf divers transmutations\nOf estates and of regions;\nOf trust, of dread,* of jealousy,                                 *doubt\nOf wit, of cunning, of folly,\nOf plenty, and of great famine,\nOf *cheap, of dearth,* and of ruin;     *cheapness & dearness (of food)*\nOf good or of mis-government,\nOf fire, and diverse accident.\nAnd lo! this house of which I write,\n*Sicker be ye,* it was not lite;*                    *be assured* *small\nFor it was sixty mile of length,\nAll* was the timber of no strength;                            *although\nYet it is founded to endure,\n*While that it list to Adventure,*               *while fortune pleases*\nThat is the mother of tidings,\nAs is the sea of wells and springs;\nAnd it was shapen like a cage.\n\"Certes,\" quoth I, \"in all mine age,*                              *life\nNe'er saw I such a house as this.\"\n\nAnd as I wonder'd me, y-wis,\nUpon this house, then ware was I\nHow that mine eagle, faste by,\nWas perched high upon a stone;\nAnd I gan straighte to him go'n,\nAnd saide thus; \"I praye thee\nThat thou a while abide* me,                                   *wait for\nFor Godde's love, and let me see\nWhat wonders in this place be;\nFor yet parauntre* I may lear**

*happened\n\"No,\" quoth he; \"telle me what.\"\nAnd then he told him this and that,\nAnd swore thereto, that it was sooth;\n\"Thus hath he said,\" and \"Thus he do'th,\"\nAnd \"Thus shall 't be,\" and \"Thus heard I say\n\"That shall be found, that dare I lay;\"*                          *wager\nThat all the folk that is alive\nHave not the cunning to descrive*                              *describe\nThe thinges that I hearde there,\nWhat aloud, and what in th'ear.\nBut all the wonder most was this;\nWhen one had heard a thing, y-wis,\nHe came straight to another wight,\nAnd gan him tellen anon right\nThe same tale that to him was told,\nOr it a furlong way was old, <84>\nAnd gan somewhat for to eche*                                  *eke, add\nTo this tiding in his speech,\nMore than it ever spoken was.\nAnd not so soon departed n'as*                                      *was\nHe from him, than that he met\nWith the third; and *ere he let\nAny stound,* he told him als';                *without delaying a momen*\nWere the tidings true or false,\nYet would he tell it natheless,\nAnd evermore with more increase\nThan it was erst.* Thus north and south                        *at first\nWent ev'ry tiding from mouth to mouth,\nAnd that increasing evermo',\nAs fire is wont to *quick and go*             *become alive, and spread*\nFrom a spark y-sprung amiss,\nTill all a city

mighte thereout pass,\nIt gan creep out at some crevass,*                       *crevice, chink\nAnd fly forth faste for the nonce.\nAnd sometimes saw I there at once\n*A leasing, and a sad sooth saw,*            *a falsehood and an earnest\nThat gan *of adventure* draw                     true saying* *by chance\nOut at a window for to pace;\nAnd when they metten in that place,\nThey were checked both the two,\nAnd neither of them might out go;\nFor other so they gan *to crowd,*            *push, squeeze, each other*\nTill each of them gan cryen loud,\n\"Let me go first!\" -- \"Nay, but let me!\nAnd here I will ensure thee,\nWith vowes, if thou wilt do so,\nThat I shall never from thee go,\nBut be thine owen sworen brother!\nWe will us medle* each with other,                               *mingle\nThat no man, be he ne'er so wroth,\nShall have one of us two, but both\nAt ones, as *beside his leave,*                     *despite his desire*\nCome we at morning or at eve,\nBe we cried or *still y-rowned.\"*                    *quietly whispered*\nThus saw I false and sooth, compouned,*                      *compounded\nTogether fly for one tiding.\nThen out at holes gan to

doth the faire white moon;\nAnd let them go. There might I see\nWinged wonders full fast flee,\nTwenty thousand in a rout,*                                     *company\nAs Aeolus them blew about.\nAnd, Lord! this House in alle times\nWas full of shipmen and pilgrimes, <85>\nWith *scrippes bretfull of leasings,*    *wallets brimful of falsehoods*\nEntremedled with tidings*                                  *true stories\nAnd eke alone by themselve.\nAnd many thousand times twelve\nSaw I eke of these pardoners,<86>\nCouriers, and eke messengers,\nWith boistes* crammed full of lies                                *boxes\nAs ever vessel was with lyes.*                             *lees of wine\nAnd as I altherfaste* went                               *with all speed\nAbout, and did all mine intent\nMe *for to play and for to lear,*         *to amuse and instruct myself*\nAnd eke a tiding for to hear\nThat I had heard of some country,\nThat shall not now be told for me; --\nFor it no need is, readily;\nFolk can sing it better than I.\nFor all must out, or late or rath,*                                *soon\nAll the sheaves in the lath;*                                 *barn <87>\nI heard a greate noise withal\nIn a corner of the hall,\nWhere men of love tidings told;\nAnd I gan thitherward behold,\nFor I saw running ev'ry wight\nAs fast as that they hadde might,\nAnd ev'reach cried, \"What thing is that?\"\nAnd some said, \"I know never what.\"\nAnd when they were all on a heap,\nThose behinde gan up leap,\nAnd clomb* upon each other fast, <88>                           *climbed\nAnd up the noise on high they cast,\nAnd trodden fast on others' heels,\nAnd stamp'd, as men do after eels.\n\nBut at the last I saw a man,\nWhich that I not describe can;\nBut that he seemed for to be\nA man of great authority.\nAnd therewith I anon abraid*                                      *awoke\nOut of my sleepe, half afraid;\nRememb'ring well what I had seen,\nAnd how high and far I had been\nIn my ghost; and had great wonder\nOf what the mighty god of thunder\nHad let me know; and gan to write\nLike as ye have me heard endite.\nWherefore to study and read alway\nI purpose to do day by day.\nAnd thus, in dreaming and in game,\nEndeth this little book of Fame.\n\nHere endeth the Book of Fame\n\n\nNotes to The House of Fame\n\n\n1. Rood: the cross on which Christ was crucified; Anglo-Saxon,\n\"Rode.\"\n\n2. Well worth of this thing greate clerks: Great scholars set\nmuch worth upon this thing --  that is, devote much labour,\nattach much importance, to the subject of dreams.\n\n3. The poet briefly refers to the description of the House of\nSomnus, in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses,\" 1. xi. 592, et seqq.; where\nthe cave of Somnus is said to be \"prope Cimmerios,\" (\"near the\nCimmerians\") and \"Saxo tamen exit ab imo Rivus aquae\nLethes.\" (\"A stream of Lethe's water issues from the base of the\nrock\")\n\n4. See the account of the vision of Croesus in The Monk's Tale.\n\n5. The meaning of the allusion is not clear; but the story of the\npilgrims and the peas is perhaps suggested by the line following\n-- \"to make lithe [soft] what erst was hard.\" St Leonard was the\npatron of captives.\n\n5. Corsaint:  The \"corpus sanctum\" -- the holy body, or relics,\npreserved in the shrine.\n\n7. So, in the Temple of Venus described in The Knight's Tale,\nthe Goddess is represented as \"naked floating in the large sea\".\n\n8. Vulcano: Vulcan, the husband of Venus.\n\n9. Ered: ploughed; Latin, \"arare,\" Anglo-Saxon, \"erean,\"\nplough.\n\n10. Sours: Soaring ascent; a hawk was said to be \"on the soar\"\nwhen he mounted, \"on the sours\" or \"souse\" when he\ndescended on the prey, and took it in flight.\n\n11. This is only one among many instances in which Chaucer\ndisclaims the pursuits of love; and the description of his manner\nof life which follows is sufficient to show that the disclaimer\nwas no mere mock-humble affectation of a gallant.\n\n12. This reference, approximately fixing the date at which the\npoem was composed, points clearly to Chaucer's daily work as\nComptroller of the Customs -- a post which he held from 1374\nto 1386.\n\n13. This is a frank enough admission that the poet was fond of\ngood cheer; and the effect of his \"little abstinence\" on his\ncorporeal appearance is humorously described in the Prologue\nto the Tale of Sir Thopas, where the Host compliments Chaucer\non being as well shapen in the waist as himself.\n\n14. \"To make the beard\" means to befool or deceive. See note\n15 to the Reeve's Tale. Precisely the same idea is conveyed in\nthe modern slang word \"shave\" -- meaning a trick or fraud.\n\n15. Love-days: see note 21 to the Prologue to the Canterbury\nTales.\n\n16. If this reference is to any book of Chaucer's in which the\nHouse of Fame was mentioned, the book has not come down to\nus. It has been reasonably supposed, however, that Chaucer\nmeans by \"his own book\" Ovid's \"Metamorphoses,\" of which he\nwas evidently very fond; and in the twelfth book of that poem\nthe Temple of Fame is described.\n\n17. Saint Julian was the patron of hospitality; so the Franklin, in\nthe Prologue to The Canterbury Tales is said to be \"Saint Julian\nin his country,\" for his open house and liberal cheer. The eagle,\nat sight of the House of Fame, cries out \"bon hostel!\" -- \"a fair\nlodging, a glorious house, by St Julian!\"\n\n18. The laurel-tree is sacred to Apollo.  See note 11 to The\nAssembly of Fowls.\n\n19. French, \"roche,\" a rock.\n\n20. St. Thomas of Kent:  Thomas a Beckett, whose shrine was\nat Canterbury.\n\n21. The half or side of the rock which was towards the poet,\nwas inscribed with, etc.\n\n22. Cop: summit; German, \"kopf\"; the head.\n\n23. Gestiours:  tellers of stories; reciters of brave feats or\n\"gests.\"\n\n24. Arion: the celebrated Greek bard and citharist, who, in the\nseventh century before Christ, lived at the court of Periander,\ntyrant of Corinth. The story of his preservation by the dolphin,\nwhen the covetous sailors forced him to leap into the sea, is\nwell known.\n\n25. Chiron the Centaur was renowned for skill in music and the\narts, which he owed to the teaching of Apollo and Artemis. He\nbecame in turn the instructor of Peleus, Achilles, and other\ndescendants of Aeacus; hence he is called \"Aeacides\" -- because\ntutor to the Aeacides, and thus, so to speak, of that \"family.\"\n\n26. Glasgerion is the subject of a ballad given in \"Percy's\nReliques,\" where we are told that\n\"Glasgerion was a king's own son,\n And a harper he was good;\n He harped in the king's chamber,\n Where cup and candle stood.\"\n\n27. Cornemuse: bagpipe; French, \"cornemuse.\" Shawmies:\nshalms or psalteries; an instrument resembling a harp.\n\n28. Dulcet: a kind of pipe, probably corresponding with the\n\"dulcimer;\" the idea of sweet -- French, \"doux;\" Latin, \"dulcis\"\n-- is at the root of both words.\n\n29. In the early printed editions of Chaucer, the two names are\n\"Citherus\" and \"Proserus;\" in the manuscript which Mr Bell\nfollowed (No. 16 in the Fairfax collection) they are \"Atileris\"\nand \"Pseustis.\" But neither alternative gives more than the\nslightest clue to identification. \"Citherus\" has been retained in\nthe text; it may have been employed as an appellative of Apollo,\nderived from \"cithara,\" the instrument on which he played; and\nit is not easy to suggest a better substitute for it than \"Clonas\" -\n- an early Greek poet and musician who flourished six hundred\nyears before Christ. For \"Proserus,\" however, has been\nsubstituted \"Pronomus,\" the name of a celebrated Grecian\nplayer on the pipe, who taught Alcibiades the flute, and who\ntherefore, although Theban by birth, might naturally be said by\nthe poet to be \"of Athens.\"\n\n30. Marsyas: The Phrygian, who, having found the flute of\nAthena, which played of itself most exquisite music, challenged\nApollo to a contest, the victor in which was to do with the\nvanquished as he pleased. Marsyas was beaten, and Apollo\nflayed him alive.\n\n31. The German (Deutsche) language, in Chaucer's time, had\nnot undergone that marked literary division into German and\nDutch which was largely accomplished through the influence of\nthe works of Luther and the other Reformers. Even now, the\nflute is the favourite musical instrument of the Fatherland; and\nthe devotion of the Germans to poetry and music has been\ncelebrated since the days of Tacitus.\n\n32. Reyes: a kind of dance, or song to be accompanied with\ndancing.\n\n33. Beam: horn, trumpet; Anglo-Saxon, \"bema.\"\n\n34. Messenus: Misenus, son of Aeolus, the companion and\ntrumpeter of Aeneas, was drowned near the Campanian\nheadland called Misenum after his name. (Aeneid, vi. 162 et\nseqq.)\n\n35. Joab's fame as a trumpeter is founded on two verses in 2\nSamuel (ii. 28, xx. 22), where we are told that he \"blew a\ntrumpet,\" which all the people of Israel obeyed, in the one case\ndesisting from a pursuit, in the other raising a siege.\n\n36. Theodamas or Thiodamas, king of the Dryopes, plays a\nprominent part in the tenth book of Statius' \"Thebaid.\" Both he\nand Joab are also mentioned as great trumpeters in The\nMerchant's Tale.\n\n37. Jongelours: jugglers; French, \"jongleur.\"\n\n38. Tregetours: tricksters, jugglers. For explanation of this\nword, see note 14 to the Franklin's tale.\n\n39. Pythonesses:  women who, like the Pythia in Apollo's\ntemple at Delphi, were possessed with a spirit of divination or\nprophecy. The barbarous Latin form of the word was\n\"Pythonissa\" or \"Phitonissa.\" See note 9 to the Friar's Tale.\n\n40. Subfumigations:  a ceremony employed to drive away evil\nspirits by burning incense; the practice of smoking cattle, corn,\n&c., has not died out in some country districts.\n\n41. In certain ascendents: under certain planetary influences.\nThe next lines recall the alleged malpractices of witches, who\ntortured little images of wax, in the design of causing the same\ntorments to the person represented -- or, vice versa, treated\nthese images for the cure of hurts or sickness.\n\n42. Medea: celebrated for her magical power, through which\nshe restored to youth Aeson, the father of Jason; and caused the\ndeath of Jason's wife, Creusa, by sending her a poisoned\ngarment which consumed her to ashes.\n\n43. Circes: the sorceress Circe, who changed the companions of\nUlysses into swine.\n\n44. Calypsa: Calypso, on whose island of Ogygia Ulysses was\nwrecked. The goddess promised the hero immortality if he\nremained with her; but he refused, and, after a detention of\nseven years, she had to let him go.\n\n45. Hermes Ballenus: this is supposed to mean Hermes\nTrismegistus (of whom see note 19 to the Canon's Yeoman's\nTale); but the explanation of the word \"Ballenus\" is not quite\nobvious. The god Hermes of the Greeks (Mercurius of the\nRomans) had the surname \"Cyllenius,\" from the mountain\nwhere he was born -- Mount Cyllene, in Arcadia; and the\nalteration into \"Ballenus\" would be quite within the range of a\ncopyist's capabilities, while we find in the mythological\ncharacter of Hermes enough to warrant his being classed with\njugglers and magicians.\n\n46. Limote and Colle Tregetour seem to have been famous\nsorcerers or jugglers, but nothing is now known of either.\n\n47. Simon Magus: of whom we read in Acts viii. 9, et seqq.\n\n48. \"And made well more than it was\n     To seemen ev'rything, y-wis,\n     As kindly thing of Fame it is;\"\ni.e. It is in the nature of fame to exaggerate everything.\n\n49. Corbets: the corbels, or capitals of pillars in a Gothic\nbuilding; they were often carved with fantastic figures and\ndevices.\n\n50. A largess!: the cry with which heralds and pursuivants at a\ntournament acknowledged the gifts or largesses of the knights\nwhose achievements they celebrated.\n\n51. Nobles: gold coins of exceptional fineness. Sterlings:\nsterling coins; not \"luxemburgs\", but stamped and authorised\nmoney. See note 9 to the Miller's Tale and note 6 to the\nPrologue to the Monk's tale.\n\n52. Coat-armure: the sleeveless coat or \"tabard,\" on which the\narms of the wearer or his lord were emblazoned.\n\n53. \"But for to prove in alle wise\n     As fine as ducat of Venise\"\ni.e. In whatever way it might be proved or tested, it would be\nfound as fine as a Venetian ducat.\n\n54. Lapidaire: a treatise on precious stones.\n\n55. See imperial: a seat placed on the dais, or elevated portion\nof the hall at the upper end, where the lord and the honoured\nguests sat.\n\n56. The starres seven: Septentrion; the Great Bear or Northern\nWain, which in this country appears to be at the top of heaven.\n\n57. The Apocalypse: The last book of the New Testament, also\ncalled Revelations. The four beasts are in chapter iv. 6.\n\n58. \"Oundy\" is the French \"ondoye,\" from \"ondoyer,\" to\nundulate or wave.\n\n59. Partridges' wings: denoting swiftness.\n\n60. Hercules lost his life with the poisoned shirt of Nessus, sent\nto him by the jealous Dejanira.\n\n61. Of the secte Saturnine: Of the Saturnine school; so called\nbecause his history of the Jewish wars narrated many horrors,\ncruelties, and sufferings, over which Saturn was the presiding\ndeity. See note 71 to the Knight's tale.\n\n62. Compare the account of the \"bodies seven\" given by the\nCanon's Yeoman:\n\"Sol gold is, and Luna silver we threpe;\n Mars iron, Mercury quicksilver we clepe;\n Saturnus lead, and Jupiter is tin,\n And Venus copper, by my father's kin.\"\n\n63. Statius is called a \"Tholosan,\" because by some, among\nthem Dante, he was believed to have been a native of Tolosa,\nnow Toulouse. He wrote the \"Thebais,\" in twelve books, and\nthe \"Achilleis,\" of which only two were finished.\n\n64. Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis were the names\nattached to histories of the Trojan War pretended to have been\nwritten immediately after the fall of Troy.\n\n65. Lollius:  The unrecognisable author whom Chaucer\nprofesses to follow in his \"Troilus and Cressida,\" and who has\nbeen thought to mean Boccaccio.\n\n66. Guido de Colonna, or de Colempnis, was a native of\nMessina, who lived about the end of the thirteenth century, and\nwrote in Latin prose a history including the war of Troy.\n\n67. English Gaufrid: Geoffrey of Monmouth, who drew from\nTroy the original of the British race. See Spenser's \"Faerie\nQueen,\" book ii. canto x.\n\n68. Lucan, in his \"Pharsalia,\" a poem in ten books, recounted\nthe incidents of the war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\n69. Claudian of Alexandria, \"the most modern of the ancient\npoets,\" lived some three centuries after Christ, and among other\nworks wrote three books on \"The Rape of Proserpine.\"\n\n70. Triton was a son of Poseidon or Neptune, and represented\nusually as blowing a trumpet made of a conch or shell; he is\ntherefore introduced by Chaucer as the squire of Aeolus.\n\n71. Sky: cloud; Anglo-Saxon, \"scua;\" Greek, \"skia.\"\n\n72. Los: reputation. See note 5 to Chaucer's Tale of Meliboeus.\n\n73. Swart: black; German, \"schwarz.\"\n\n74. Tewell: the pipe, chimney, of the furnace; French \"tuyau.\"\nIn the Prologue to The Canterbury Tales, the Monk's head is\ndescribed as steaming like a lead furnace.\n\n75. Tetches: blemishes, spots; French, \"tache.\"\n\n76. For the story of Belle Isaude see note 21 to the Assembly of\nFowls.\n\n77. Quern:  mill. See note 6 to the Monk's Tale.\n\n78. To put an ape into one's hood, upon his head, is to befool\nhim; see the prologue  to the Prioresses's Tale, l.6.\n\n79. Obviously Chaucer should have said the temple of Diana, or\nArtemis (to whom, as Goddess of the Moon, the Egyptian Isis\ncorresponded), at Ephesus. The building, famous for its\nsplendour, was set on fire, in B.C. 356, by Erostatus, merely\nthat he might perpetuate his name.\n\n80. \"Now do our los be blowen swithe,\n     As wisly be thou ever blithe.\" i.e.\nCause our renown to be blown abroad quickly, as surely as you\nwish to be glad.\n\n81.

The meaning is, that the poet need not tell what tidings\nhe wanted to hear, since everything of the kind must some day\ncome out -- as sooner or later every sheaf in the barn must be\nbrought forth (to be threshed).\n\n88. A somewhat similar heaping-up of people is de scribed in\nSpenser's account of the procession of Lucifera (\"The Faerie\nQueen,\" book i. canto iv.), where, as the royal dame passes to\nher coach,\n\"The heaps of people, thronging in the hall,\n Do ride each other, upon her to gaze.\"\n\n\n\nTROILUS AND CRESSIDA.\n\n\n[In several respects, the story of \"Troilus and Cressida\" may be\nregarded as Chaucer's noblest poem. Larger in scale than any\nother of his individual works -- numbering nearly half as many\nlines as The Canterbury Tales contain, without reckoning the\ntwo in prose -- the conception of the poem is yet so closely and\nharmoniously worked out, that all the parts are perfectly\nbalanced, and from first to last scarcely a single line is\nsuperfluous or misplaced. The finish and beauty of the poem as\na work of art, are not more conspicuous than the knowledge of\nhuman nature displayed in the portraits of the principal\ncharacters. The result is, that the poem is more modern, in form\nand in spirit, than almost any other work of its author; the\nchaste style and sedulous polish of the stanzas admit of easy\nchange into the forms of speech now current in England; while\nthe analytical and subjective character of the work gives it, for\nthe nineteenth century reader, an interest of the same kind as\nthat inspired, say, by George Eliot's wonderful study of\ncharacter in \"Romola.\" Then, above all, \"Troilus and Cressida\"\nis distinguished by a purity and elevation of moral tone, that\nmay surprise those who judge of Chaucer only by the coarse\ntraits of his time preserved in The Canterbury Tales, or who\nmay expect to find here the Troilus, the Cressida, and the\nPandarus of Shakspeare's play. It is to no trivial gallant, no\nwoman of coarse mind and easy virtue, no malignantly\nsubservient and utterly debased procurer, that Chaucer\nintroduces us. His Troilus is a noble, sensitive, generous, pure-\nsouled, manly, magnanimous hero, who is only confirmed and\nstimulated in all virtue by his love, who lives for his lady, and\ndies for her falsehood, in a lofty and chivalrous fashion. His\nCressida is a stately, self-contained, virtuous, tender-hearted\nwoman, who loves with all the pure strength and trustful\nabandonment of a generous and exalted nature, and who is\ndriven to infidelity perhaps even less by pressure of\ncircumstances, than by the sheer force of her love, which will go\non loving -- loving what it can have, when that which it would\nrather have is for the time unattainable. His Pandarus is a\ngentleman, though a gentleman with a flaw in him; a man who,\nin his courtier-like good-nature, places the claims of\ncomradeship above those of honour, and plots away the virtue\nof his niece, that he may appease the love-sorrow of his friend;\nall the time conscious that he is not acting as a gentleman\nshould, and desirous that others should give him that\njustification which he can get but feebly and diffidently in\nhimself. In fact, the \"Troilus and Cressida\" of Chaucer is the\n\"Troilus and Cressida\" of Shakespeare transfigured; the\natmosphere, the colour, the spirit, are wholly different; the older\npoet presents us in the chief characters to noble natures, the\nyounger to ignoble natures in all the characters; and the poem\nwith which we have now to do stands at this day among the\nnoblest expositions of love's workings in the human heart and\nlife. It is divided into five books, containing altogether 8246\nlines. The First Book (1092 lines) tells how Calchas, priest of\nApollo, quitting beleaguered Troy, left there his only daughter\nCressida; how Troilus, the youngest brother of Hector and son\nof King Priam, fell in love with her at first sight, at a festival in\nthe temple of Pallas, and sorrowed bitterly for her love; and\nhow his friend, Cressida's uncle, Pandarus, comforted him by\nthe promise of aid in his suit. The Second Book (1757 lines)\nrelates the subtle manoeuvres of Pandarus to induce Cressida to\nreturn the love of Troilus; which he accomplishes mainly by\ntouching at once the lady's admiration for his heroism, and her\npity for his love-sorrow on her account. The Third Book (1827\nlines) opens with an account of the first interview between the\nlovers; ere it closes, the skilful stratagems of Pandarus have\nplaced the pair in each other's arms under his roof, and the\nlovers are happy in perfect enjoyment of each other's love and\ntrust. In the Fourth Book (1701 lines) the course of true love\nceases to run smooth; Cressida is compelled to quit the city, in\nransom for Antenor, captured in a skirmish; and she sadly\ndeparts to the camp of the Greeks, vowing that she will make\nher escape, and return to Troy and Troilus within ten days. The\nFifth Book (1869 lines) sets out by describing the court which\nDiomedes, appointed to escort her, pays to Cressida on the way\nto the camp; it traces her gradual progress from indifference to\nher new suitor, to incontinence with him, and it leaves the\ndeserted Troilus dead on the field of battle, where he has sought\nan eternal refuge from the new grief provoked by clear proof of\nhis mistress's infidelity. The polish, elegance, and power of the\nstyle, and the acuteness of insight into character, which mark\nthe poem, seem to claim for it a date considerably later than that\nadopted by those who assign its composition to Chaucer's\nyouth: and the literary allusions and proverbial expressions with\nwhich it abounds, give ample evidence that, if Chaucer really\nwrote it at an early age, his youth must have been precocious\nbeyond all actual record. Throughout the poem there are\nrepeated references to the old authors of Trojan histories who\nare named in \"The House of Fame\"; but Chaucer especially\nmentions one Lollius as the author from whom he takes the\ngroundwork of the poem. Lydgate is responsible for the\nassertion that Lollius meant Boccaccio; and though there is no\nauthority for supposing that the English really meant to\ndesignate the Italian poet under that name, there is abundant\ninternal proof that the poem was really founded on the\n\"Filostrato\" of Boccaccio. But the tone of Chaucer's work is\nmuch higher than that of his Italian \"auctour;\" and while in\nsome passages the imitation is very close, in all that is\ncharacteristic in \"Troilus and Cressida,\" Chaucer has fairly\nthrust his models out of sight. In the present edition, it has been\npossible to give no more than about one-fourth of the poem --\n274 out of the 1178 seven-line stanzas that compose it; but\npains have been taken to convey, in the connecting prose\npassages, a faithful idea of what is perforce omitted.]\n\n\nTHE FIRST BOOK.\n\n\nTHE double sorrow <1> of Troilus to tell,\nThat was the King Priamus' son of Troy,\nIn loving how his adventures* fell                             *fortunes\nFrom woe to weal, and after* out of joy,                     *afterwards\nMy purpose is, ere I you parte froy.*                              *from\nTisiphone,<2> thou help me to indite\nThese woeful words, that weep as I do write.\n\nTo thee I call, thou goddess of torment!\nThou cruel wight, that sorrowest ever in pain;\nHelp me, that am the sorry instrument\nThat helpeth lovers, as I can, to plain.*                      *complain\nFor well it sits,* the soothe for to sayn,                       *befits\nUnto a woeful wight a dreary fere,*                           *companion\nAnd to a sorry tale a sorry cheer.*                         *countenance\n\nFor I, that God of Love's servants serve,\nNor dare to love for mine unlikeliness,* <3>             *unsuitableness\nPraye for speed,* although I shoulde sterve,**            *success **die\nSo far I am from his help in darkness;\nBut natheless, might I do yet gladness\nTo any lover, or any love avail,*                               *advance\nHave thou the thank, and mine be the travail.\n\nBut ye lovers that bathen in gladness,\nIf any drop of pity in you be,\nRemember you for old past heaviness,\nFor Godde's love, and on adversity\nThat others suffer; think how sometime ye\nFounde how Love durste you displease;\nOr elles ye have won it with great ease.\n\nAnd pray for them that been in the case\nOf Troilus, as ye may after hear,\nThat Love them bring in heaven to solace;*             *delight, comfort\nAnd for me pray also, that God so dear\nMay give me might to show, in some mannere,\nSuch pain or woe as Love's folk endure,\nIn Troilus' *unseely adventure*                        *unhappy fortune*\n\nAnd pray for them that eke be despair'd\nIn love, that never will recover'd be;\nAnd eke for them that falsely be appair'd*                    *slandered\nThrough wicked tongues, be it he or she:\nOr thus bid* God, for his benignity,                               *pray\nTo grant them soon out of this world to pace,*                 *pass, go\nThat be despaired of their love's grace.\n\nAnd bid also for them that be at ease\nIn love, that God them grant perseverance,\nAnd send them might their loves so to please,\nThat it to them be *worship and pleasance;*        *honour and pleasure*\nFor so hope I my soul best to advance,\nTo pray for them that Love's servants be,\nAnd write their woe, and live in charity;\n\nAnd for to have of them compassion,\nAs though I were their owen brother dear.\nNow listen all with good entention,*                          *attention\nFor I will now go straight to my mattere,\nIn which ye shall the double sorrow hear\nOf Troilus, in loving of Cresside,\nAnd how that she forsook him ere she died.\n\nIn Troy, during the siege, dwelt \"a lord of great authority, a\ngreat divine,\" named Calchas; who, through the oracle of\nApollo, knew that Troy should be destroyed. He stole away\nsecretly to the Greek camp, where he was gladly received, and\nhonoured for his skill in divining, of which the besiegers hoped\nto make use. Within the city there was great anger at the\ntreason of Calchas; and the people declared that he and all his\nkin were worthy to be burnt. His daughter, whom he had left in\nthe city, a widow and alone, was in great fear for her life.\n\nCressida was this lady's name aright;\n*As to my doom,* in alle Troy city                      *in my judgment*\nSo fair was none, for over ev'ry wight\nSo angelic was her native beauty,\nThat like a thing immortal seemed she,\nAs sooth a perfect heav'nly creature,\nThat down seem'd sent in scorning of Nature.\n\nIn her distress, \"well nigh out of her wit for pure fear,\" she\nappealed for protection to Hector; who, \"piteous of nature,\"\nand touched by her sorrow and her beauty, assured her of\nsafety, so long as she pleased to dwell in Troy. The siege went\non; but they of Troy did not neglect the honour and worship of\ntheir deities; most of all of \"the relic hight Palladion, <4> that\nwas their trust aboven ev'ry one.\" In April, \"when clothed is the\nmead with newe green, of jolly Ver [Spring] the prime,\" the\nTrojans went to hold the festival of Palladion --  crowding to\nthe temple, \"in all their beste guise,\" lusty knights, fresh ladies,\nand maidens bright.\n\nAmong the which was this Cresseida,\nIn widow's habit black; but natheless,\nRight as our firste letter is now A,\nIn beauty first so stood she makeless;*                       *matchless\nHer goodly looking gladded all the press;*                        *crowd\nWas never seen thing to be praised derre,*          *dearer, more worthy\nNor under blacke cloud so bright a sterre,*                        *star\n\nAs she was, as they saiden, ev'ry one\nThat her behelden in her blacke weed;*                          *garment\nAnd yet she stood, full low and still, alone,\nBehind all other folk, *in little brede,*              *inconspicuously*\nAnd nigh the door, ay *under shame's drede;*        *for dread of shame*\nSimple of bearing, debonair* of cheer,                         *gracious\nWith a full sure* looking and mannere.                          *assured\n\nDan Troilus, as he was wont to guide\nHis younge knightes, led them up and down\nIn that large temple upon ev'ry side,\nBeholding ay the ladies of the town;\nNow here, now there, for no devotioun\nHad he to none, to *reave him* his rest,                *deprive him of*\nBut gan to *praise and lacke whom him lest;*       *praise and disparage\n                                                        whom he pleased*\nAnd in his walk full fast he gan to wait*                *watch, observe\nIf knight or squier of his company\nGan for to sigh, or let his eyen bait*                             *feed\nOn any woman that he could espy;\nThen he would smile, and hold it a folly,\nAnd say him thus: \"Ah, Lord, she sleepeth soft\nFor love of thee, when as thou turnest oft.\n\n\"I have heard told, pardie, of your living,\nYe lovers, and your lewed* observance,                *ignorant, foolish\nAnd what a labour folk have in winning\nOf love, and in it keeping with doubtance;*                       *doubt\nAnd when your prey is lost, woe and penance;*                 *suffering\nOh, very fooles!

He set at\nnaught every other charge, but to gaze on her as often as he\ncould; thinking so to appease his hot fire, which thereby only\nburned the hotter. He wrought marvellous feats of arms against\nthe Greeks, that she might like him the better for his renown;\nthen love deprived him of sleep, and made his food his foe; till\nhe had to \"borrow a title of other sickness,\" that men might not\nknow he was consumed with love. Meantime, Cressida gave no\nsign that she heeded his devotion, or even knew of it; and he\nwas now consumed with a new fear -- lest she loved some other\nman. Bewailing his sad lot -- ensnared, exposed to the scorn of\nthose whose love he had ridiculed, wishing himself arrived at\nthe port of death, and praying ever that his lady might glad him\nwith some kind look -- Troilus is surprised in his chamber by his\nfriend Pandarus, the uncle of Cressida. Pandarus, seeking to\ndivert his sorrow by making him angry, jeeringly asks whether\nremorse of conscience, or devotion, or fear of the Greeks, has\ncaused all this ado. Troilus pitifully beseeches his friend to leave\nhim to die alone, for die he must, from a cause which he must\nkeep hidden; but Pandarus argues against Troilus' cruelty in\nhiding from a friend such a sorrow, and Troilus at last confesses\nthat his malady is love. Pandarus suggests that the beloved\nobject may be such that his counsel might advance his friend's\ndesires; but Troilus scouts the suggestion, saying that Pandarus\ncould never govern himself in love.\n\n\"Yea, Troilus, hearken to me,\" quoth Pandare,\n\"Though I be nice;* it happens often so,                        *foolish\nThat one that access* doth full evil fare,        *in an access of fever\nBy good counsel can keep his friend therefro'.\nI have my selfe seen a blind man go\nWhere as he fell that looke could full wide;\nA fool may eke a wise man often guide.\n\n\"A whetstone is no carving instrument,\nBut yet it maketh sharpe carving tooles;\nAnd, if thou know'st that I have aught miswent,*          *erred, failed\nEschew thou that, for such thing to thee school* is.  *schooling, lesson\nThus oughte wise men to beware by fooles;\nIf so thou do, thy wit is well bewared;\nBy its contrary is everything declared.\n\n\"For how might ever sweetness have been know\nTo him that never tasted bitterness?\nAnd no man knows what gladness is, I trow,\nThat never was in sorrow or distress:\nEke white by black, by shame eke worthiness,\nEach set by other, *more for other seemeth,*        *its quality is made\nAs men may see; and so the wise man deemeth.\"            more obvious by\n                                                           the contrast*\nTroilus, however, still begs his friend to leave him to mourn in\npeace, for all his proverbs can avail nothing. But Pandarus\ninsists on plying the lover with wise saws, arguments,\nreproaches; hints that, if he should die of love, his lady may\nimpute his death to fear of the Greeks; and finally induces\nTroilus to admit that the well of all his woe, his sweetest foe, is\ncalled Cressida. Pandarus breaks into praises of the lady, and\ncongratulations of his friend for so well fixing his heart; he\nmakes Troilus utter a formal confession of his sin in jesting at\nlovers and bids him think well that she of whom rises all his\nwoe, hereafter may his comfort be also.\n\n\"For thilke* ground, that bears the weedes wick'              *that same\nBears eke the wholesome herbes, and full oft\nNext to the foule nettle, rough and thick,\nThe lily waxeth,* white, and smooth, and soft;                    *grows\nAnd next the valley is the hill aloft,\nAnd next the darke night is the glad morrow,\nAnd also joy is next the fine* of sorrow.\"                  *end, border\n\nPandarus holds out to Troilus good hope of achieving his\ndesire; and tells him that, since he has been converted from his\nwicked rebellion against Love, he shall be made the best post of\nall Love's law, and most grieve Love's enemies. Troilus gives\nutterance to a hint of fear; but he is silenced by Pandarus with\nanother proverb --  \"Thou hast full great care, lest that the carl\nshould fall out of the moon.\" Then the lovesick youth breaks\ninto a joyous boast that some of the Greeks shall smart; he\nmounts his horse, and plays the lion in the field; while Pandarus\nretires to consider how he may best recommend to his niece the\nsuit of Troilus.\n\n\nTHE SECOND BOOK.\n\n\nIN the Proem to the Second Book, the poet hails the clear\nweather that enables him to sail out of those black waves in\nwhich his boat so laboured that he could scarcely steer -- that is,\n\"the tempestuous matter of despair, that Troilus was in; but\nnow of hope the kalendes begin.\" He invokes the aid of Clio;\nexcuses himself to every lover for what may be found amiss in a\nbook which he only translates; and, obviating any lover's\nobjection to the way in which Troilus obtained his lady's grace -\n- through Pandarus' mediation -- says it seems to him no\nwonderful thing:\n\n\"For ev'ry wighte that to Rome went\nHeld not one path, nor alway one mannere;\nEke in some lands were all the game y-shent\nIf that men far'd in love as men do here,\nAs thus, in open dealing and in cheer,\nIn visiting, in form, or saying their saws;*                   *speeches\nFor thus men say: Each country hath its laws.\n\n\"Eke scarcely be there in this place three\nThat have in love done or said *like in all;\"*   *alike in all respects*\n\nAnd so that which the poem relates may not please the reader --\nbut it actually was done, or it shall yet be done. The Book sets\nout with the visit of Pandarus to Cressida:--\n\nIn May, that mother is of monthes glade,*                          *glad\nWhen all the freshe flowers, green and red,\nBe quick* again, that winter deade made,                          *alive\nAnd full of balm is floating ev'ry mead;\nWhen Phoebus doth his brighte beames spread\nRight in the white Bull, so it betid*                          *happened\nAs I shall sing, on Maye's day the thrid, <11>\n\nThat Pandarus, for all his wise speech,\nFelt eke his part of Love's shottes keen,\nThat, could he ne'er so well of Love preach,\nIt made yet his hue all day full green;*                           *pale\nSo *shope it,* that him fell that day a teen*      *it happened* *access\nIn love, for which full woe to bed he went,\nAnd made ere it were day full many a went.*                *turning <12>\n\nThe swallow Progne, <13> with a sorrowful lay,\nWhen morrow came, gan make her waimenting,*                   *lamenting\nWhy she foshapen* was; and ever lay                         *transformed\nPandare a-bed, half in a slumbering,\nTill she so nigh him made her chittering,\nHow Tereus gan forth her sister take,\nThat with the noise of her he did awake,\n\nAnd gan to call, and dress* him to arise,                       *prepare\nRememb'ring him his errand was to do'n\nFrom Troilus, and eke his great emprise;\nAnd cast, and knew in *good plight* was the Moon     *favourable aspect*\nTo do voyage, and took his way full soon\nUnto his niece's palace there beside\nNow Janus, god of entry, thou him guide!\n\nPandarus finds his niece, with two other ladies, in a paved\nparlour, listening to a maiden who reads aloud the story of the\nSiege of Thebes. Greeting the company, he is welcomed by\nCressida, who tells him that for three nights she has dreamed of\nhim. After some lively talk about the book they had been\nreading, Pandarus asks his niece to do away her hood, to show\nher face bare, to lay aside the book, to rise up and dance, \"and\nlet us do to May some observance.\" Cressida cries out, \"God\nforbid!\" and asks if he is mad -- if that is a widow's life, whom it\nbetter becomes to sit in a cave and read of holy saints' lives.\nPandarus intimates that he could tell her something which could\nmake her merry; but he refuses to gratify her curiosity; and, by\nway of the siege and of Hector, \"that was the towne's wall, and\nGreekes' yerd\" or scourging-rod, the conversation is brought\nround to Troilus, whom Pandarus highly extols as \"the wise\nworthy Hector the second.\" She has, she says, already heard\nTroilus praised for his bravery \"of them that her were liefest\npraised be\" [by whom it would be most welcome to her to be\npraised].\n\n\"Ye say right sooth, y-wis,\" quoth Pandarus;\nFor yesterday, who so had with him been,\nMight have wonder'd upon Troilus;\nFor never yet so thick a swarm of been*                            *bees\nNe flew, as did of Greekes from him flee'n;\nAnd through the field, in ev'ry wighte's ear,\nThere was no cry but 'Troilus is here.'\n\n\"Now here, now there, he hunted them so fast,\nThere was but Greekes' blood; and Troilus\nNow him he hurt, now him adown he cast;\nAy where he went it was arrayed thus:\nHe was their death, and shield of life for us,\nThat as that day there durst him none withstand,\nWhile that he held his bloody sword in hand.\"\n\nPandarus makes now a show of taking leave, but Cressida\ndetains him, to speak of her affairs; then, the business talked\nover, he would again go, but first again asks his niece to arise\nand dance, and cast her widow's garments to mischance,\nbecause of the glad fortune that has befallen her. More curious\nthan ever, she seeks to find out Pandarus' secret; but he still\nparries her curiosity, skilfully hinting all the time at her good\nfortune, and the wisdom of seizing on it when offered. In the\nend he tells her that the noble Troilus so loves her, that with her\nit lies to make him live or die -- but if Troilus dies, Pandarus\nshall die with him; and then she will have \"fished fair.\" <14> He\nbeseeches mercy for his friend:\n\n\"*Woe worth* the faire gemme virtueless! <15>             *evil befall!*\nWoe worth the herb also that *doth no boot!*     *has no remedial power*\nWoe worth the beauty that is rutheless!*                      *merciless\nWoe worth that wight that treads each under foot!\nAnd ye that be of beauty *crop and root*                *perfection <16>\nIf therewithal in you there be no ruth,*                           *pity\nThen is it harm ye live, by my truth!\"\n\nPandarus makes only the slight request that she will show\nTroilus somewhat better cheer, and receive visits from him, that\nhis life may be saved; urging that, although a man be soon going\nto the temple, nobody will think that he eats the images; and\nthat \"such love of friends reigneth in all this town.\"\n\nCressida, which that heard him in this wise,\nThought: \"I shall feele* what he means, y-wis;\"                    *test\n\"Now, eme* quoth she, \"what would ye me devise?                   *uncle\nWhat is your rede* that I should do of this?\"          *counsel, opinion\n\"That is well said,\" quoth he;\" certain best it is\nThat ye him love again for his loving,\nAs love for love is *skilful guerdoning.*        *reasonable recompense*\n\n\"Think eke how elde* wasteth ev'ry hour                             *age\nIn each of you a part of your beauty;\nAnd therefore, ere that age do you devour,\nGo love, for, old, there will no wight love thee\nLet this proverb a lore* unto you be:                            *lesson\n'\"Too late I was ware,\" quoth beauty when it past;\nAnd *elde daunteth danger* at the last.'     *old age overcomes disdain*\n\n\"The kinge's fool is wont to cry aloud,\nWhen that he thinks a woman bears her high,\n'So longe may ye liven, and all proud,\nTill crowes' feet be wox* under your eye!                         *grown\nAnd send you then a mirror *in to pry*                      *to look in*\nIn which ye may your face see a-morrow!*                 *in the morning\n*I keep then wishe you no more sorrow.'\"*            *I care to wish you\n                                                          nothing worse*\nWeeping, Cressida reproaches her uncle for giving her such\ncounsel; whereupon Pandarus, starting up, threatens to kill\nhimself, and would fain depart, but that his niece detains him,\nand, with much reluctance, promises to \"make Troilus good\ncheer in honour.\" Invited by Cressida to tell how first he know\nher lover's woe, Pandarus then relates two soliloquies which he\nhad accidentally overheard, and in which Troilus had poured\nout all the sorrow of his passion.\n\nWith this he took his leave, and home he went\nAh!

The singer, having praised the lover and rebuked\nthe revilers of love, proceeds:\n\n\"What is the Sunne worse of his *kind right,*              *true nature*\nThough that a man, for feebleness of eyen,\nMay not endure to see on it for bright? <27>\nOr Love the worse, tho' wretches on it cryen?\nNo weal* is worth, that may no sorrow drien;** <28>  *happiness **endure\nAnd forthy,* who that hath a head of verre,**    *therefore **glass <29>\nFrom cast of stones ware him in the werre. <30>\n\n\"But I, with all my heart and all my might,\nAs I have lov'd, will love unto my last\nMy deare heart, and all my owen knight,\nIn which my heart y-growen is so fast,\nAnd his in me, that it shall ever last\n*All dread I* first to love him begin,               *although I feared*\nNow wot I well there is no pain therein.\"\n\nCressida sighs, and asks Antigone whether there is such bliss\namong these lovers, as they can fair endite; Antigone replies\nconfidently in the affirmative; and Cressida answers nothing,\n\"but every worde which she heard she gan to printen in her\nhearte fast.\" Night draws on:\n\nThe daye's honour, and the heaven's eye,\nThe nighte's foe, -- all this call I the Sun, --\nGan westren* fast, and downward for to wry,**       *go west <31> **turn\nAs he that had his daye's course y-run;\nAnd white thinges gan to waxe dun\nFor lack of light, and starres to appear;\nThen she and all her folk went home in fere.*                *in company\n\nSo, when it liked her to go to rest,\nAnd voided* were those that voiden ought,       *gone out (of the house)\nShe saide, that to sleepe well her lest.*                       *pleased\nHer women soon unto her bed her brought;\nWhen all was shut, then lay she still and thought\nOf all these things the manner and the wise;\nRehearse it needeth not, for ye be wise.\n\nA nightingale upon a cedar green,\nUnder the chamber wall where as she lay,\nFull loude sang against the moone sheen,\nParauntre,* in his birde's wise, a lay                        *perchance\nOf love, that made her hearte fresh and gay;\nHereat hark'd* she so long in good intent,                     *listened\nTill at the last the deade sleep her hent.*                      *seized\n\nAnd as she slept, anon right then *her mette*              *she dreamed*\nHow that an eagle, feather'd white as bone,\nUnder her breast his longe clawes set,\nAnd out her heart he rent, and that anon,\nAnd did* his heart into her breast to go'n,                      *caused\nOf which no thing she was *abash'd nor smert;*         *amazed nor hurt*\nAnd forth he flew, with hearte left for heart.\n\nLeaving Cressida to sleep, the poet returns to Troilus and his\nzealous friend -- with whose stratagems to bring the two lovers\ntogether the remainder of the Second Book is occupied.\nPandarus counsels Troilus to write a letter to his mistress,\ntelling her how he \"fares amiss,\" and \"beseeching her of ruth;\"\nhe will bear the letter to his niece; and, if Troilus will ride past\nCressida's house, he will find his mistress and his friend sitting\nat a window. Saluting Pandarus, and not tarrying, his passage\nwill give occasion for some talk of him, which may make his\nears glow. With respect to the letter, Pandarus gives some\nshrewd hints:\n\n\"Touching thy letter, thou art wise enough,\nI wot thou *n'ilt it dignely endite*       *wilt not write it haughtily*\nOr make it with these argumentes tough,\nNor scrivener-like, nor craftily it write;\nBeblot it with thy tears also a lite;*                           *little\nAnd if thou write a goodly word all soft,\nThough it be good, rehearse it not too oft.\n\n\"For though the beste harper *pon live*                           *alive\nWould on the best y-sounded jolly harp\nThat ever was, with all his fingers five\nTouch ay one string, or *ay one warble harp,*     *always play one tune*\nWere his nailes pointed ne'er so sharp,\nHe shoulde maken ev'ry wight to dull*                     *to grow bored\nTo hear his glee, and of his strokes full.\n\n\"Nor jompre* eke no discordant thing y-fere,**        *jumble **together\nAs thus, to use termes of physic;\nIn love's termes hold of thy mattere\nThe form alway, and *do that it be like;*           *make it consistent*\nFor if a painter woulde paint a pike\nWith ass's feet, and head it as an ape,<32>\nIt *'cordeth not,* so were it but a jape.\"           *is not harmonious*\n\nTroilus writes the letter, and next morning Pandarus bears it to\nCressida. She refuses to receive \"scrip or bill that toucheth such\nmattere;\" but he thrusts it into her bosom, challenging her to\nthrow it away. She retains it, takes the first opportunity of\nescaping to her chamber to read it, finds it wholly good, and,\nunder her uncle's dictation, endites a reply telling her lover that\nshe will not make herself bound in love; \"but as his sister, him\nto please, she would aye fain [be glad] to do his heart an ease.\"\nPandarus, under pretext of inquiring who is the owner of the\nhouse opposite, has gone to the window; Cressida takes her\nletter to him there, and tells him that she never did a thing with\nmore pain than write the words to which he had constrained\nher. As they sit side by side, on a stone of jasper, on a cushion\nof beaten gold, Troilus rides by, in all his goodliness. Cressida\nwaxes \"as red as rose,\" as she sees him salute humbly, \"with\ndreadful cheer, and oft his hues mue [change];\" she likes \"all\ny-fere, his person, his array, his look, his cheer, his goodly\nmanner, and his gentleness;\" so that, however she may have\nbeen before, \"to goode hope now hath she caught a thorn, she\nshall not pull it out this nexte week.\" Pandarus, striking the iron\nwhen it is hot, asks his niece to grant Troilus an interview; but\nshe strenuously declines, for fear of scandal, and because it is all\ntoo soon to allow him so great a liberty -- her purpose being to\nlove him unknown of all, \"and guerdon [reward] him with\nnothing but with sight.\" Pandarus has other intentions; and,\nwhile Troilus writes daily letters with increasing love, he\ncontrives the means of an interview. Seeking out Deiphobus,\nthe brother of Troilus, he tells him that Cressida is in danger of\nviolence from Polyphete, and asks protection for her.\nDeiphobus gladly complies, promises the protection of Hector\nand Helen, and goes to invite Cressida to dinner on the morrow.\nMeantime Pandarus instructs Troilus to go to the house of\nDeiphobus, plead an access of his fever for remaining all night,\nand keep his chamber next day. \"Lo,\" says the crafty promoter\nof love, borrowing a phrase from the hunting-field; \"Lo, hold\nthee at thy tristre [tryst <33>] close, and I shall well the deer\nunto thy bowe drive.\" Unsuspicious of stratagem, Cressida\ncomes to dinner; and at table, Helen, Pandarus, and others,\npraise the absent Troilus, until \"her heart laughs\" for very pride\nthat she has the love of such a knight. After dinner they speak\nof Cressida's business; all confirm Deiphobus' assurances of\nprotection and aid; and Pandarus suggests that, since Troilus is\nthere, Cressida shall herself tell him her case. Helen and\nDeiphobus alone accompany Pandarus to Troilus' chamber;\nthere Troilus produces some documents relating to the public\nweal, which Hector has sent for his opinion; Helen and\nDeiphobus, engrossed in perusal and discussion, roam out of\nthe chamber, by a stair, into the garden; while Pandarus goes\ndown to the hall, and, pretending that his brother and Helen are\nstill with Troilus, brings Cressida to her lover. The Second\nBook leaves Pandarus whispering in his niece's ear counsel to\nbe merciful and kind to her lover, that hath for her such pain;\nwhile Troilus lies \"in a kankerdort,\" <34> hearing the\nwhispering without, and wondering what he shall say for this\n\"was the first time that he should her pray of love; O! mighty\nGod! what shall he say?\"\n\n\nTHE THIRD BOOK.\n\n\nTo the Third Book is prefixed a beautiful invocation of Venus,\nunder the character of light:\n\nO Blissful light, of which the beames clear\nAdornen all the thirde heaven fair!\nO Sunne's love, O Jove's daughter dear!\nPleasance of love, O goodly debonair,*             *lovely and gracious*\nIn gentle heart ay* ready to repair!**         *always **enter and abide\nO very* cause of heal** and of gladness,                 *true **welfare\nY-heried* be thy might and thy goodness!                        *praised\n\nIn heav'n and hell, in earth and salte sea.\nIs felt thy might, if that I well discern;\nAs man, bird, beast, fish, herb, and greene tree,\nThey feel in times, with vapour etern, <35>\nGod loveth, and to love he will not wern                          forbid\nAnd in this world no living creature\nWithoute love is worth, or may endure. <36>\n\nYe Jove first to those effectes glad,\nThrough which that thinges alle live and be,\nCommended; and him amorous y-made\nOf mortal thing; and as ye list,* ay ye                         *pleased\nGave him, in love, ease* or adversity,                         *pleasure\nAnd in a thousand formes down him sent\nFor love in earth; and *whom ye list he hent.*       *he seized whom you\n                                                                 wished*\nYe fierce Mars appeasen of his ire,\nAnd as you list ye make heartes dign* <37>                       *worthy\nAlgates* them that ye will set afire,                     *at all events\nThey dreade shame, and vices they resign\nYe do* him courteous to be, and benign;                     *make, cause\nAnd high or low, after* a wight intendeth,                 *according as\nThe joyes that he hath your might him sendeth.\n\nYe holde realm and house in unity;\nYe soothfast* cause of friendship be also;                         *true\nYe know all thilke *cover'd quality*                      *secret power*\nOf thinges which that folk on wonder so,\nWhen they may not construe how it may go\nShe loveth him, or why he loveth her,\nAs why this fish, not that, comes to the weir.*<38>           *fish-trap\n\nKnowing that Venus has set a law in the universe, that whoso\nstrives with her shall have the worse, the poet prays to be\ntaught to describe some of the joy that is felt in her service; and\nthe Third Book opens with an account of the scene between\nTroilus and Cressida:\n\nLay all this meane while Troilus\nRecording* his lesson in this mannere;                       *memorizing\n*\"My fay!\"* thought he, \"thus will I say, and thus;       *by my faith!*\nThus will I plain* unto my lady dear;                    *make my plaint\nThat word is good; and this shall be my cheer\nThis will I not forgetten in no wise;\"\nGod let him worken as he can devise.\n\nAnd, Lord! so as his heart began to quap,*                  *quake, pant\nHearing her coming, and *short for to sike;*          *make short sighs*\nAnd Pandarus, that led her by the lap,*                           *skirt\nCame near, and gan in at the curtain pick,*                        *peep\nAnd saide: \"God do boot* alle sick!                  *afford a remedy to\nSee who is here you coming to visite;\nLo! here is she that is *your death to wite!\"*\t*to blame for your death*\n\nTherewith it seemed as he wept almost.\n\"Ah! ah!

When\nhe has got rid of them by feigning weariness, Pandarus returns\nto the chamber, and spends the night with him in converse. The\nzealous friend begins to speak \"in a sober wise\" to Troilus,\nreminding him of his love-pains now all at an end.\n\n\"So that through me thou standest now in way\nTo fare well; I say it for no boast;\nAnd know'st thou why?

On the morrow Troilus burned as the fire, for\nhope and pleasure; yet \"he not forgot his wise governance [self-\ncontrol];\"\n\nBut in himself with manhood gan restrain\nEach rakel* deed, and each unbridled cheer,**          *rash **demeanour\nThat alle those that live, sooth to sayn,\nShould not have wist,* by word or by mannere,                 *suspicion\nWhat that he meant, as touching this mattere;\nFrom ev'ry wight as far as is the cloud\nHe was, so well dissimulate he could.\n\nAnd all the while that I now devise*                  *describe, narrate\nThis was his life: with all his fulle might,\nBy day he was in Marte's high service,\nThat is to say, in armes as a knight;\nAnd, for the moste part, the longe night\nHe lay, and thought how that he mighte serve\nHis lady best, her thank* for to deserve.                     *gratitude\n\nI will not swear, although he laye soft,\nThat in his thought he n'as somewhat diseas'd;*                *troubled\nNor that he turned on his pillows oft,\nAnd would of that him missed have been seis'd;*               *possessed\nBut in such case men be not alway pleas'd,\nFor aught I wot, no more than was he;\nThat can I deem* of possibility.                                  *judge\n\nBut certain is, to purpose for to go,\nThat in this while, as written is in gest,*              *the history of\nHe saw his lady sometimes, and also                         these events\nShe with him spake, when that she *durst and lest;*  *dared and pleased*\nAnd, by their both advice,* as was the best,               *consultation\n*Appointed full warily* in this need,        *made careful preparations*\nSo as they durst, how far they would proceed.\n\nBut it was spoken in *so short a wise,   *so briefly, and always in such\nIn such await alway, and in such fear,       vigilance and fear of being\nLest any wight divinen or devise*                   found out by anyone*\nWould of their speech, or to it lay an ear,\n*That all this world them not so lefe were,*      *they wanted more than\nAs that Cupido would them grace send              anything in the world*\nTo maken of their speeches right an end.\n\nBut thilke little that they spake or wrought,\nHis wise ghost* took ay of all such heed,                        *spirit\nIt seemed her he wiste what she thought\nWithoute word, so that it was no need\nTo bid him aught to do, nor aught forbid;\nFor which she thought that love, all* came it late,            *although\nOf alle joy had open'd her the gate.\n\nTroilus, by his discretion, his secrecy, and his devotion, made\never a deeper lodgment in Cressida's heart; so that she thanked\nGod twenty thousand times that she had met with a man who,\nas she felt, \"was to her a wall of steel, and shield from ev'ry\ndispleasance;\" while Pandarus ever actively fanned the fire. So\npassed a \"time sweet\" of tranquil and harmonious love the only\ndrawback being, that the lovers might not often meet, \"nor\nleisure have, their speeches to fulfil.\" At last Pandarus found an\noccasion for bringing them together at his house unknown to\nanybody, and put his plan in execution.\n\nFor he, with great deliberation,\nHad ev'ry thing that hereto might avail*                  *be of service\nForecast, and put in execution,\nAnd neither left for cost nor for travail;*                      *effort\nCome if them list, them shoulde nothing fail,\n*Nor for to be in aught espied there,\nThat wiste he an impossible were.*           *he knew it was impossible*\n                                    that they could be discovered there*\nAnd dreadeless* it clear was in the wind                  *without doubt\nOf ev'ry pie, and every let-game; <49>\nNow all is well, for all this world is blind,\nIn this mattere, bothe fremd* and tame; <50>                       *wild\nThis timber is all ready for to frame;\nUs lacketh naught, but that we weete* wo'ld                        *know\nA certain hour in which we come sho'ld. <51>\n\nTroilus had informed his household, that if at any time he was\nmissing, he had gone to worship at a certain temple of Apollo,\n\"and first to see the holy laurel quake, or that the godde spake\nout of the tree.\" So, at the changing of the moon, when \"the\nwelkin shope him for to rain,\" [when the sky was preparing to\nrain] Pandarus went to invite his niece to supper; solemnly\nassuring her that Troilus was out of the town -- though all the\ntime he was safely shut up, till midnight, in \"a little stew,\"\nwhence through a hole he joyously watched the arrival of his\nmistress and her fair niece Antigone, with half a score of her\nwomen. After supper Pandaras did everything to amuse his\nniece; \"he sung, he play'd, he told a tale of Wade;\" <52> at last\nshe would take her leave; but\n\nThe bente Moone with her hornes pale,\nSaturn, and Jove, in Cancer joined were, <53>\nThat made such a rain from heav'n avail,*                       *descend\nThat ev'ry manner woman that was there\nHad of this smoky rain <54> a very fear;\nAt which Pandarus laugh'd, and saide then\n\"Now were it time a lady to go hen!\"*                             *hence\n\nHe therefore presses Cressida to remain all night; she complies\nwith a good grace; and after the sleeping cup has gone round,\nall retire to their chambers -- Cressida, that she may not be\ndisturbed by the rain and thunder, being lodged in the \"inner\ncloset\" of Pandarus, who, to lull suspicion, occupies the outer\nchamber, his niece's women sleeping in the intermediate\napartment. When all is quiet, Pandarus liberates Troilus, and by\na secret passage brings him to the chamber of Cressida; then,\ngoing forward alone to his niece, after calming her fears of\ndiscovery, he tells her that her lover has \"through a gutter, by a\nprivy went,\" [a secret passage] come to his house in all this rain,\nmad with grief because a friend has told him that she loves\nHorastes. Suddenly cold about her heart, Cressida promises that\non the morrow she will reassure her lover; but Pandarus scouts\nthe notion of delay, laughs to scorn her proposal to send her\nring in pledge of her truth, and finally, by pitiable accounts of\nTroilus' grief, induces her to receive him and reassure him at\nonce with her own lips.\n\nThis Troilus full soon on knees him set,\nFull soberly, right by her bedde's head,\nAnd in his beste wise his lady gret*                            *greeted\nBut Lord! how she wax'd suddenly all red,\nAnd thought anon how that she would be dead;\nShe coulde not one word aright out bring,\nSo suddenly for his sudden coming.\n\nCressida, though thinking that her servant and her knight should\nnot have doubted her truth, yet sought to remove his jealousy,\nand offered to submit to any ordeal or oath he might impose;\nthen, weeping, she covered her face, and lay silent. \"But now,\"\nexclaims the poet --\n\nBut now help, God, to quenchen all this sorrow!\nSo hope I that he shall, for he best may;\nFor I have seen, of a full misty morrow,*                          *morn\nFollowen oft a merry summer's day,\nAnd after winter cometh greene May;\nFolk see all day, and eke men read in stories,\nThat after sharpe stoures* be victories.           *conflicts, struggles\n\nBelieving his mistress to be angry, Troilus felt the cramp of\ndeath seize on his heart, \"and down he fell all suddenly in\nswoon.\" Pandarus \"into bed him cast,\" and called on his niece to\npull out the thorn that stuck in his heart, by promising that she\nwould \"all forgive.\" She whispered in his ear the assurance that\nshe was not wroth; and at last, under her caresses, he recovered\nconsciousness, to find her arm laid over him, to hear the\nassurance of her forgiveness, and receive her frequent kisses.\nFresh vows and explanations passed; and Cressida implored\nforgiveness of \"her own sweet heart,\" for the pain she had\ncaused him. Surprised with sudden bliss, Troilus put all in God's\nhand, and strained his lady fast in his arms. \"What might or may\nthe seely [innocent] larke say, when that the sperhawk\n[sparrowhawk] hath him in his foot?\"\n\nCressida, which that felt her thus y-take,\nAs write clerkes in their bookes old,\nRight as an aspen leaf began to quake,\nWhen she him felt her in his armes fold;\nBut Troilus, all *whole of cares cold,*   *cured of painful sorrows*<55>\nGan thanke then the blissful goddes seven. <56>\nThus sundry paines bringe folk to heaven.\n\nThis Troilus her gan in armes strain,\nAnd said, \"O sweet, as ever may I go'n,*                        *prosper\nNow be ye caught, now here is but we twain,\nNow yielde you, for other boot* is none.\"                        *remedy\nTo that Cresside answered thus anon,\n\"N' had I ere now, my sweete hearte dear,\n*Been yolden,* y-wis, I were now not here!\"             *yielded myself*\n\nO sooth is said, that healed for to be\nOf a fever, or other great sickness,\nMen muste drink, as we may often see,\nFull bitter drink; and for to have gladness\nMen drinken often pain and great distress!\nI mean it here, as for this adventure,\nThat thorough pain hath founden all his cure.\n\nAnd now sweetnesse seemeth far more sweet,\nThat bitterness assayed* was beforn;                        *tasted <57>\nFor out of woe in blisse now they fleet,*                   *float, swim\nNone such they felte since that they were born;\nNow is it better than both two were lorn! <58>\nFor love of God, take ev'ry woman heed\nTo worke thus, if it come to the need!\n\nCresside, all quit from ev'ry dread and teen,*                     *pain\nAs she that juste cause had him to trust,\nMade him such feast,<59> it joy was for to see'n,\nWhen she his truth and *intent cleane wist;*            *knew the purity\nAnd as about a tree, with many a twist,                  of his purpose*\n*Bitrent and writhen* is the sweet woodbind,      *plaited and wreathed*\nGan each of them in armes other wind.*                *embrace, encircle\n\nAnd as the *new abashed* nightingale,          *newly-arrived and timid*\nThat stinteth,* first when she beginneth sing,                    *stops\nWhen that she heareth any *herde's tale,*    *the talking of a shepherd*\nOr in the hedges any wight stirring;\nAnd, after, sicker* out her voice doth ring;                *confidently\nRight so Cressida, when *her dreade stent,*           *her doubt ceased*\nOpen'd her heart, and told him her intent.*                        *mind\n\nAnd might as he that sees his death y-shapen,*                 *prepared\nAnd dien must, *in aught that he may guess,*       *for all he can tell*\nAnd suddenly *rescouse doth him escapen,*    *he is rescued and escapes*\nAnd from his death is brought *in sickerness;*               *to safety*\nFor all the world, in such present gladness\nWas Troilus, and had his lady sweet;\nWith worse hap God let us never meet!\n\nHer armes small, her straighte back and soft,\nHer sides longe, fleshly, smooth, and white,\nHe gan to stroke; and good thrift* bade full oft               *blessing\nOn her snow-white throat, her breastes round and lite;*           *small\nThus in this heaven he gan him delight,\nAnd therewithal a thousand times her kist,\nThat what to do for joy *unneth he wist.*               *he hardly knew*\n\nThe lovers exchanged vows, and kisses, and embraces, and\nspeeches of exalted love, and rings; Cressida gave to Troilus a\nbrooch of gold and azure, \"in which a ruby set was like a heart;\"\nand the too short night passed.\n\n\"When that the cock, commune astrologer, <60>\nGan on his breast to beat, and after crow,\nAnd Lucifer, the daye's messenger,\nGan for to rise, and out his beames throw;\nAnd eastward rose, to him that could it know,\nFortuna Major, <61> then anon Cresseide,\nWith hearte sore, to Troilus thus said:\n\n\"My hearte's life, my trust, and my pleasance!\nThat I was born, alas! that me is woe,\nThat day of us must make disseverance!\nFor time it is to rise, and hence to go,\nOr else I am but lost for evermo'.\nO Night! alas! why n'ilt thou o'er us hove,*                      *hover\nAs long as when Alcmena lay by Jove?

The effects of love on Troilus are altogether refining\nand ennobling; as may be inferred from the song which he sung\noften to Pandarus:\n\nThe Second Song of Troilus.\n\n\"Love, that of Earth and Sea hath governance!\nLove, that his hestes* hath in Heaven high!                *commandments\nLove, that with a right wholesome alliance\nHolds people joined, as him list them guy!*                       *guide\nLove, that knitteth law and company,\nAnd couples doth in virtue for to dwell,\nBind this accord, that I have told, and tell!\n\n\"That the worlde, with faith which that is stable,\nDiverseth so, his *stoundes according;*       *according to its seasons*\nThat elementes, that be discordable,*                        *discordant\nHolden a bond perpetually during;\nThat Phoebus may his rosy day forth bring;\nAnd that the Moon hath lordship o'er the night; --\nAll this doth Love, ay heried* be his might!                    *praised\n\n\"That the sea, which that greedy is to flowen,\nConstraineth to a certain ende* so                                *limit\nHis floodes, that so fiercely they not growen\nTo drenchen* earth and all for evermo';                           *drown\nAnd if that Love aught let his bridle go,\nAll that now loves asunder shoulde leap,\nAnd lost were all that Love holds now *to heap.*         *together <66>*\n\n\"So woulde God, that author is of kind,\nThat with his bond Love of his virtue list\nTo cherish heartes, and all fast to bind,\nThat from his bond no wight the way out wist!\nAnd heartes cold, them would I that he twist,*                   *turned\nTo make them love; and that him list ay rue*                  *have pity\nOn heartes sore, and keep them that be true.\"\n\nBut Troilus' love had higher fruits than singing:\n\nIn alle needes for the towne's werre*                               *war\nHe was, and ay the first in armes dight,*            *equipped, prepared\nAnd certainly, but if that bookes err,\nSave Hector, most y-dread* of any wight;                        *dreaded\nAnd this increase of hardiness* and might                       *courage\nCame him of love, his lady's grace to win,\nThat altered his spirit so within.\n\nIn time of truce, a-hawking would he ride,\nOr elles hunt the boare, bear, lioun;\nThe smalle beastes let he go beside;<67>\nAnd when he came riding into the town,\nFull oft his lady, from her window down,\nAs fresh as falcon coming out of mew,*                        *cage <68>\nFull ready was him goodly to salue.*                             *salute\n\n\nAnd most of love and virtue was his speech,\nAnd *in despite he had all wretchedness*           *he held in scorn all\nAnd doubtless no need was him to beseech             despicable actions*\nTo honour them that hadde worthiness,\nAnd ease them that weren in distress;\nAnd glad was he, if any wight well far'd,\nThat lover was, when he it wist or heard.\n\nFor he held every man lost unless he were in Love's service;\nand, so did the power of Love work within him, that he was ay\n[always] humble and benign, and \"pride, envy, ire, and avarice,\nhe gan to flee, and ev'ry other vice.\"\n\n\nTHE FOURTH BOOK\n\n\nA BRIEF Proem to the Fourth Book prepares us for the\ntreachery of Fortune to Troilus; from whom she turned away\nher bright face, and took of him no heed, \"and cast him clean\nout of his lady's grace, and on her wheel she set up Diomede.\"\nThen the narrative describes a skirmish in which the Trojans\nwere worsted, and Antenor, with many of less note, remained in\nthe hands of the Greeks. A truce was proclaimed for the\nexchange of prisoners; and as soon as Calchas heard the news,\nhe came to the assembly of the Greeks, to \"bid a boon.\" Having\ngained audience, he reminded the besiegers how he had come\nfrom Troy to aid and encourage them in their enterprise; willing\nto lose all that he had in the city, except his daughter Cressida,\nwhom he bitterly reproached himself for leaving behind. And\nnow, with streaming tears and pitiful prayer, he besought them\nto exchange Antenor for Cressida; assuring them that the day\nwas at hand when they should have both town and people. The\nsoothsayer's petition was granted; and the ambassadors charged\nto negotiate the exchange, entering the city, told their errand to\nKing Priam and his parliament.\n\nThis Troilus was present in the place\nWhen asked was for Antenor Cresside;\nFor which to change soon began his face,\nAs he that with the wordes well nigh died;\nBut natheless he no word to it seid;*                              *said\nLest men should his affection espy,\nWith manne's heart he gan his sorrows drie;*                     *endure\n\nAnd, full of anguish and of grisly dread,\nAbode what other lords would to it say,\nAnd if they woulde grant, -- as God forbid! --\nTh'exchange of her, then thought he thinges tway:*                  *two\nFirst, for to save her honour; and what way\nHe mighte best th'exchange of her withstand;\nThis cast he then how all this mighte stand.\n\nLove made him alle *prest to do her bide,*      *eager to make her stay*\nAnd rather die than that she shoulde go;\nBut Reason said him, on the other side,\n\"Without th'assent of her, do thou not so,\nLest for thy worke she would be thy foe;\nAnd say, that through thy meddling is y-blow*    *divulged, blown abroad\nYour bothe love, where it was *erst unknow.\"*       *previously unknown*\n\nFor which he gan deliberate for the best,\nThat though the lordes woulde that she went,\nHe woulde suffer them grant what *them lest,*             *they pleased*\nAnd tell his lady first what that they meant;\nAnd, when that she had told him her intent,\nThereafter would he worken all so blive,*                      *speedily\nThough all the world against it woulde strive.\n\nHector, which that full well the Greekes heard,\nFor Antenor how they would have Cresseide,\nGan it withstand, and soberly answer'd;\n\"Sirs, she is no prisoner,\"  he said;\n\"I know not on you who this charge laid;\nBut, for my part, ye may well soon him tell,\nWe use* here no women for to sell.\"                      *are accustomed\n\nThe noise of the people then upstart at once,\nAs breme* as blaze of straw y-set on fire              *violent, furious\nFor Infortune* woulde for the nonce                          *Misfortune\nThey shoulde their confusion desire\n\"Hector,\" quoth they, \"what ghost* may you inspire               *spirit\nThis woman thus to shield, and *do us* lose                *cause us to*\nDan Antenor? -- a wrong way now ye choose, --\n\n\"That is so wise, and eke so bold baroun;\nAnd we have need of folk, as men may see\nHe eke is one the greatest of this town;\nO Hector! lette such fantasies be!\nO King Priam!\" quoth they, \"lo! thus say we,\nThat all our will is to forego Cresseide;\"\nAnd to deliver Antenor they pray'd.\n\nThough Hector often prayed them \"nay,\" it was resolved that\nCressida should be given up for Antenor; then the parliament\ndispersed. Troilus hastened home to his chamber, shut himself\nup alone, and threw himself on his bed.\n\nAnd as in winter leaves be bereft,\nEach after other, till the tree be bare,\nSo that there is but bark and branch y-left,\nLay Troilus, bereft of each welfare,\nY-bounden in the blacke bark of care,\nDisposed *wood out of his wit to braid,*       *to go out of his senses*\n*So sore him sat* the changing of Cresseide.        *so ill did he bear*\n\nHe rose him up, and ev'ry door he shet,*                           *shut\nAnd window eke; and then this sorrowful man\nUpon his bedde's side adown him set,\nFull like a dead image, pale and wan,\nAnd in his breast the heaped woe began\nOut burst, and he to worken in this wise,\nIn his woodness,* as I shall you devise.**             *madness **relate\n\nRight as the wilde bull begins to spring,\nNow here, now there, y-darted* to the heart,        *pierced with a dart\nAnd of his death roareth in complaining;\nRight so gan he about the chamber start,\nSmiting his breast aye with his fistes smart;*       *painfully, cruelly\nHis head to the wall, his body to the ground,\nFull oft he swapt,* himselfe to confound.                *struck, dashed\n\nHis eyen then, for pity of his heart,\nOut streameden as swifte welles* tway;                        *fountains\nThe highe sobbes of his sorrow's smart\nHis speech him reft; unnethes* might he say,                   *scarcely\n\"O Death, alas! *why n'ilt thou do me dey?*            *why will you not\nAccursed be that day which that Nature                     make me die?*\nShope* me to be a living creature!\"                              *shaped\n\nBitterly reviling Fortune, and calling on Love to explain why his\nhappiness with Cressicla should be thus repealed, Troilus\ndeclares that, while he lives, he will bewail his misfortune in\nsolitude, and will never see it shine or rain, but will end his\nsorrowful life in darkness, and die in distress.\n\n\"O weary ghost, that errest to and fro!\nWhy n'ilt* thou fly out of the woefulest                       *wilt not\nBody that ever might on grounde go?\nO soule, lurking in this woeful nest!\nFlee forth out of my heart, and let it brest,*                    *burst\nAnd follow alway Cresside, thy lady dear!\nThy righte place is now no longer here.\n\n\"O woeful eyen two! since your disport*                         *delight\nWas all to see Cressida's eyen bright,\nWhat shall ye do, but, for my discomfort,\nStande for naught, and weepen out your sight,\nSince she is quench'd, that wont was you to light?\nIn vain, from this forth, have I eyen tway\nY-formed, since your virtue is away!\n\n\"O my Cresside!

At his friend's arrival, Troilus \"gan as the snow against\nthe sun to melt;\" the two mingled their tears a while; then\nPandarus strove to comfort the woeful lover. He admitted that\nnever had a stranger ruin than this been wrought by Fortune:\n\n\"But tell me this, why thou art now so mad\nTo sorrow thus? Why li'st thou in this wise,\nSince thy desire all wholly hast thou had,\nSo that by right it ought enough suffice?\nBut I, that never felt in my service\nA friendly cheer or looking of an eye,\nLet me thus weep and wail until I die. <70>\n\n\"And over all this, as thou well wost* thy selve,               *knowest\nThis town is full of ladies all about,\nAnd, *to my doom,* fairer than suche twelve             *in my judgment*\nAs ever she was, shall I find in some rout,*                    *company\nYea! one or two, withouten any doubt:\nForthy* be glad, mine owen deare brother!                     *therefore\nIf she be lost, we shall recover another.\n\n\"What!

Then he points out\nthe folly of not lamenting the loss of Cressida because she had\nbeen his in ease and felicity --  while Pandarus himself, though\nhe thought it so light to change to and fro in love, had not done\nbusily his might to change her that wrought him all the woe of\nhis unprosperous suit.\n\n\"If thou hast had in love ay yet mischance,\nAnd canst it not out of thine hearte drive,\nI that lived in lust* and in pleasance                          *delight\nWith her, as much as creature alive,\nHow should I that forget, and that so blive?*                   *quickly\nO where hast thou been so long hid in mew,*<74>                    *cage\nThat canst so well and formally argue!\"\n\nThe lover condemns the whole discourse of his friend as\nunworthy, and calls on Death, the ender of all sorrows, to come\nto him and quench his heart with his cold stroke. Then he distils\nanew in tears, \"as liquor out of alembic;\" and Pandarus is silent\nfor a while, till he bethinks him to recommend to Troilus the\ncarrying off of Cressida. \"Art thou in Troy, and hast no\nhardiment [daring, boldness] to take a woman which that loveth\nthee?\"  But Troilus reminds his counsellor that all the war had\ncome from the ravishing of a woman by might (the abduction of\nHelen by Paris); and that it would not beseem him to withstand\nhis father's grant, since the lady was to be changed for the\ntown's good. He has dismissed the thought of asking Cressida\nfrom his father, because that would be to injure her fair fame, to\nno purpose, for Priam could not overthrow the decision of \"so\nhigh a place as parliament;\" while most of all he fears to perturb\nher heart with violence, to the slander of her name -- for he\nmust hold her honour dearer than himself in every case, as\nlovers ought of right:\n\n\"Thus am I in desire and reason twight:*                        *twisted\nDesire, for to disturbe her, me redeth;*                     *counseleth\nAnd Reason will not, so my hearte dreadeth.\"*               *is in doubt\n\nThus weeping, that he coulde never cease\nHe said, \"Alas! how shall I, wretche, fare?\nFor well feel I alway my love increase,\nAnd hope is less and less alway, Pandare!\nIncreasen eke the causes of my care;\nSo well-away! *why n' ill my hearte brest?*                *why will not\nFor us in love there is but little rest.\"               my heart break?*\n\nPandare answered, \"Friend, thou may'st for me\nDo as thee list;* but had I it so hot,                           *please\nAnd thine estate,* she shoulde go with me!                         *rank\nThough all this town cried on this thing by note,\nI would not set* all that noise a groat;                          *value\nFor when men have well cried, then will they rown,*             *whisper\nEke wonder lasts but nine nights ne'er in town.\n\n\"Divine not in reason ay so deep,\nNor courteously, but help thyself anon;\nBet* is that others than thyselfe weep;                          *better\nAnd namely, since ye two be all one,\nRise up, for, by my head, she shall not go'n!\nAnd rather be in blame a little found,\nThan sterve* here as a gnat withoute wound!                         *die\n\n\"It is no shame unto you, nor no vice,\nHer to withholde, that ye loveth most;\nParauntre* she might holde thee for nice,**      *peradventure **foolish\nTo let her go thus unto the Greeks' host;\nThink eke, Fortune, as well thyselfe wost,\nHelpeth the hardy man to his emprise,\nAnd weiveth* wretches for their cowardice.                    *forsaketh\n\n\"And though thy lady would a lite* her grieve,                   *little\nThou shalt thyself thy peace thereafter make;\nBut, as to me, certain I cannot 'lieve\nThat she would it as now for evil take:\nWhy shoulde then for fear thine hearte quake?\nThink eke how Paris hath, that is thy brother,\nA love; and why shalt thou not have another?\n\n\"And, Troilus, one thing I dare thee swear,\nThat if Cressida, which that is thy lief,*                         *love\nNow loveth thee as well as thou dost her,\nGod help me so, she will not take agrief*                         *amiss\nThough thou *anon do boot in* this mischief;           *provide a remedy\nAnd if she willeth from thee for to pass,                   immediately*\nThen is she false, so love her well the lass.*                     *less\n\n\"Forthy,* take heart, and think, right as a knight,           *therefore\nThrough love is broken all day ev'ry law;\nKithe* now somewhat thy courage and thy might;                     *show\nHave mercy on thyself, *for any awe;*             *in spite of any fear*\nLet not this wretched woe thine hearte gnaw;\nBut, manly, set the world on six and seven, <75>\nAnd, if thou die a martyr, go to heaven.\"\n\nPandarus promises his friend all aid in the enterprise; it is agreed\nthat Cressida shall be carried off, but only with her own\nconsent; and Pandarus sets out for his niece's house, to arrange\nan interview. Meantime Cressida has heard the news; and,\ncaring nothing for her father, but everything for Troilus, she\nburns in love and fear, unable to tell what she shall do.\n\nBut, as men see in town, and all about,\nThat women use* friendes to visite,                      *are accustomed\nSo to Cresside of women came a rout,*                             *troop\nFor piteous joy, and *weened her delight,*       *thought to please her*\nAnd with their tales, *dear enough a mite,*           *not worth a mite*\nThese women, which that in the city dwell,\nThey set them down, and said as I shall tell.\n\nQuoth first that one, \"I am glad, truely,\nBecause of you, that shall your father see;\"\nAnother said, \"Y-wis, so am not I,\nFor all too little hath she with us be.\"*                          *been\nQuoth then the third, \"I hope, y-wis, that she\nShall bringen us the peace on ev'ry side;\nThen, when she goes, Almighty God her guide!\"\n\nThose wordes, and those womanishe thinges,\nShe heard them right as though she thennes* were,       *thence; in some\nFor, God it wot, her heart on other thing is;                other place\nAlthough the body sat among them there,\nHer advertence* is always elleswhere;                         *attention\nFor Troilus full fast her soule sought;\nWithoute word, on him alway she thought.\n\nThese women that thus weened her to please,\nAboute naught gan all their tales spend;\nSuch vanity ne can do her no ease,\nAs she that all this meane while brenn'd\nOf other passion than that they wend;*                 *weened, supposed\nSo that she felt almost her hearte die\nFor woe, and weary* of that company.                          *weariness\n\nFor whiche she no longer might restrain\nHer teares, they began so up to well,\nThat gave signes of her bitter pain,\nIn which her spirit was, and muste dwell,\nRememb'ring her from heav'n into which hell\nShe fallen was, since she forwent* the sight                       *lost\nOf Troilus; and sorrowfully she sight.*                          *sighed\n\nAnd thilke fooles, sitting her about,\nWeened that she had wept and siked* sore,                        *sighed\nBecause that she should out of that rout*                       *company\nDepart, and never playe with them more;\nAnd they that hadde knowen her of yore\nSaw her so weep, and thought it kindeness,\nAnd each of them wept eke for her distress.\n\nAnd busily they gonnen* her comfort                               *began\nOf thing, God wot, on which she little thought;\nAnd with their tales weened her disport,\nAnd to be glad they her besought;\nBut such an ease therewith they in her wrought,\nRight as a man is eased for to feel,\nFor ache of head, to claw him on his heel.\n\nBut, after all this nice* vanity,                                 *silly\nThey took their leave, and home they wenten all;\nCressida, full of sorrowful pity,\nInto her chamber up went out of the hall,\nAnd on her bed she gan for dead to fall,\nIn purpose never thennes for to rise;\nAnd thus she wrought, as I shall you devise.*                   *narrate\n\nShe rent her sunny hair, wrung her hands, wept, and bewailed\nher fate; vowing that, since, \"for the cruelty,\" she could handle\nneither sword nor dart, she would abstain from meat and drink\nuntil she died. As she lamented, Pandarus entered, making her\ncomplain a thousand times more at the thought of all the joy\nwhich he had given her with her lover; but he somewhat\nsoothed her by the prospect of Troilus's visit, and by the\ncounsel to contain her grief when he should come. Then\nPandarus went in search of Troilus, whom he found solitary in a\ntemple, as one that had ceased to care for life:\n\nFor right thus was his argument alway:\nHe said he was but lorne,* well-away!

Cressida swooned away, so\nthat Troilus took her for dead; and, having tenderly laid out her\nlimbs, as one preparing a corpse for the bier, he drew his sword\nto slay himself upon her body. But, as God would, just at that\nmoment she awoke out of her swoon; and by and by the pair\nbegan to talk of their prospects. Cressida declared the opinion,\nsupporting it at great length and with many reasons, that there\nwas no cause for half so much woe on either part. Her\nsurrender, decreed by the parliament, could not be resisted; it\nwas quite easy for them soon to meet again; she would bring\nthings about that she should be back in Troy within a week or\ntwo; she would take advantage of the constant coming and\ngoing while the truce lasted; and the issue would be, that the\nTrojans would have both her and Antenor; while, to facilitate\nher return, she had devised a stratagem by which, working on\nher father's avarice, she might tempt him to desert from the\nGreek camp back to the city. \"And truly,\" says the poet, having\nfully reported her plausible speech,\n\nAnd truely, as written well I find,\nThat all this thing was said *of good intent,*               *sincerely*\nAnd that her hearte true was and kind\nTowardes him, and spake right as she meant,\nAnd that she starf* for woe nigh when she went,                    *died\nAnd was in purpose ever to be true;\nThus write they that of her workes knew.\n\nThis Troilus, with heart and ears y-sprad,*                    *all open\nHeard all this thing devised to and fro,\nAnd verily it seemed that he had\n*The selfe wit;* but yet to let her go                *the same opinion*\nHis hearte misforgave* him evermo';                             *misgave\nBut, finally, he gan his hearte wrest*                           *compel\nTo truste her, and took it for the best.\n\nFor which the great fury of his penance*                      *suffering\nWas quench'd with hope, and therewith them between\nBegan for joy the amorouse dance;\nAnd as the birdes, when the sun is sheen,                        *bright\nDelighten in their song, in leaves green,\nRight so the wordes that they spake y-fere*                    *together\nDelighten them, and make their heartes cheer.*                     *glad\n\nYet Troilus was not so well at ease, that he did not earnestly\nentreat Cressida to observe her promise; for, if she came not\ninto Troy at the set day, he should never have health, honour, or\njoy; and he feared that the stratagem by which she would try to\nlure her father back would fail, so that she might be compelled\nto remain among the Greeks. He would rather have them steal\naway together, with sufficient treasure to maintain them all their\nlives; and even if they went in their bare shirt, he had kin and\nfriends elsewhere, who would welcome and honour them.\n\nCressida, with a sigh, right in this wise\nAnswer'd; \"Y-wis, my deare hearte true,\nWe may well steal away, as ye devise,\nAnd finde such unthrifty wayes new;\nBut afterward full sore *it will us rue;*            *we will regret it*\nAnd help me God so at my moste need\nAs causeless ye suffer all this dread!\n\n\"For thilke* day that I for cherishing                        *that same\nOr dread of father, or of other wight,\nOr for estate, delight, or for wedding,\nBe false to you, my Troilus, my knight,\nSaturne's daughter Juno, through her might,\nAs wood* as Athamante <78> do me dwell                              *mad\nEternally in Styx the pit of hell!\n\n\"And this, on ev'ry god celestial\nI swear it you, and eke on each goddess,\nOn ev'ry nymph, and deity infernal,\nOn Satyrs and on Faunes more or less,\nThat *halfe goddes* be of wilderness;                          *demigods\nAnd Atropos my thread of life to-brest,*                  *break utterly\nIf I be false! now trow* me if you lest.**             *believe **please\n\n\"And thou Simois, <79> that as an arrow clear\nThrough Troy ay runnest downward to the sea,\nBear witness of this word that said is here!\nThat thilke day that I untrue be\nTo Troilus, mine owen hearte free,\nThat thou returne backward to thy well,\nAnd I with body and soul sink in hell!\"\n\nEven yet Troilus was not wholly content, and urged anew his\nplan of secret flight; but Cressida turned upon him with the\ncharge that he mistrusted her causelessly, and demanded of him\nthat he should be faithful in her absence, else she must die at her\nreturn. Troilus promised faithfulness in far simpler and briefer\nwords than Cressida had used.\n\n\"Grand mercy, good heart mine, y-wis,\" quoth she;\n\"And blissful Venus let me never sterve,*                           *die\nEre I may stand *of pleasance in degree          in a position to reward\nTo quite him*  that so well can deserve;         him well with pleasure*\nAnd while that God my wit will me conserve,\nI shall so do; so true I have you found,\nThat ay honour to me-ward shall rebound.\n\n\"For truste well that your estate* royal,                          *rank\nNor vain delight, nor only worthiness\nOf you in war or tourney martial,\nNor pomp, array, nobley, nor eke richess,\nNe made me to rue* on your distress;                          *take pity\nBut moral virtue, grounded upon truth,\nThat was the cause I first had on you ruth.*                       *pity\n\n\"Eke gentle heart, and manhood that ye had,\nAnd that ye had, -- as me thought, -- in despite\nEvery thing that *sounded unto* bad,        *tended unto, accorded with*\nAs rudeness, and peoplish* appetite,                             *vulgar\nAnd that your reason bridled your delight;\nThis made, aboven ev'ry creature,\nThat I was yours, and shall while I may dure.\n\n\"And this may length of yeares not fordo,*             *destroy, do away\nNor remuable* Fortune deface;                                  *unstable\nBut Jupiter, that of his might may do\nThe sorrowful to be glad, so give us grace,\nEre nightes ten to meeten in this place,\nSo that it may your heart and mine suffice!\nAnd fare now well, for time is that ye rise.\"\n\nThe lovers took a heart-rending adieu; and Troilus, suffering\nunimaginable anguish, \"withoute more, out of the chamber\nwent.\"\n\n\nTHE FIFTH BOOK.\n\n\nAPPROACHE gan the fatal destiny\nThat Jovis hath in disposition,\nAnd to you angry Parcae,* Sisters three,                      *The Fates\nCommitteth to do execution;\nFor which Cressida must out of the town,\nAnd Troilus shall dwelle forth in pine,*                           *pain\nTill Lachesis his thread no longer twine.*                        *twist\n\nThe golden-tressed Phoebus, high aloft,\nThries* had alle, with his beames clear,                         *thrice\nThe snowes molt,* and Zephyrus as oft                            *melted\nY-brought again the tender leaves green,\nSince that *the son of Hecuba the queen*                  *Troilus <80>*\nBegan to love her first, for whom his sorrow\nWas all, that she depart should on the morrow\n\nIn the morning, Diomede was ready to escort Cressida to the\nGreek host; and Troilus, seeing him mount his horse, could with\ndifficulty resist an impulse to slay him -- but restrained himself,\nlest his lady should be also slain in the tumult. When Cressida\nwas ready to go,\n\nThis Troilus, in guise of courtesy,\nWith hawk on hand, and with a huge rout*                 *retinue, crowd\nOf knightes, rode, and did her company,\nPassing alle the valley far without;\nAnd farther would have ridden, out of doubt,\nFull fain,* and woe was him to go so soon,                       *gladly\nBut turn he must, and it was eke to do'n.\n\nAnd right with that was Antenor y-come\nOut of the Greekes' host, and ev'ry wight\nWas of it glad, and said he was welcome;\nAnd Troilus, *all n'ere his hearte light,*           *although his heart\nHe pained him, with all his fulle might,                  was not light*\nHim to withhold from weeping at the least;\nAnd Antenor he kiss'd and made feast.\n\nAnd therewithal he must his leave take,\nAnd cast his eye upon her piteously,\nAnd near he rode, his cause* for to make               *excuse, occasion\nTo take her by the hand all soberly;\nAnd, Lord! so she gan weepe tenderly!\nAnd he full soft and slily gan her say,\n\"Now hold your day, and *do me not to dey.\"*        *do not make me die*\n\nWith that his courser turned he about,\nWith face pale, and unto Diomede\nNo word he spake, nor none of all his rout;\nOf which the son of Tydeus <81> tooke heed,\nAs he that couthe* more than the creed <82>                        *knew\nIn such a craft, and by the rein her hent;*                        *took\nAnd Troilus to Troye homeward went.\n\nThis Diomede, that led her by the bridle,\nWhen that he saw the folk of Troy away,\nThought, \"All my labour shall not be *on idle,*               *in  vain*\nIf that I may, for somewhat shall I say;\nFor, at the worst, it may yet short our way;\nI have heard say eke, times twice twelve,\nHe is a fool that will forget himselve.\"\n\nBut natheless, this thought he well enough,\nThat \"Certainly I am aboute naught,\nIf that I speak of love, or *make it tough;*           *make any violent\nFor, doubteless, if she have in her thought            immediate effort*\nHim that I guess, he may not be y-brought\nSo soon away; but I shall find a mean,\nThat she *not wit as yet shall* what I mean.\"       *shall not yet know*\n\nSo he began a general conversation, assured her of not less\nfriendship and honour among the Greeks than she had enjoyed\nin Troy, and requested of her earnestly to treat him as a brother\nand accept his service -- for, at last he said, \"I am and shall be\nay, while that my life may dure, your own, aboven ev'ry\ncreature.\n\n\"Thus said I never e'er now to woman born;\nFor, God mine heart as wisly* gladden so!                        *surely\nI loved never woman herebeforn,\nAs paramours, nor ever shall no mo';\nAnd for the love of God be not my foe,\nAll* can I not to you, my lady dear,                           *although\nComplain aright, for I am yet to lear.*                           *teach\n\n\"And wonder not, mine owen lady bright,\nThough that I speak of love to you thus blive;*                    *soon\nFor I have heard ere this of many a wight\nThat loved thing he ne'er saw in his live;\nEke I am not of power for to strive\nAgainst the god of Love, but him obey\nI will alway, and mercy I you pray.\"\n\nCressida answered his discourses as though she scarcely heard\nthem; yet she thanked him for his trouble and courtesy, and\naccepted his offered friendship -- promising to trust him, as well\nshe might. Then she alighted from her steed, and, with her heart\nnigh breaking, was welcomed to the embrace of her father.\nMeanwhile Troilus, back in Troy, was lamenting with tears the\nloss of his love, despairing of his or her ability to survive the ten\ndays, and spending the night in wailing, sleepless tossing, and\ntroublous dreams. In the morning he was visited by Pandarus,\nto whom he gave directions for his funeral; desiring that the\npowder into which his heart was burned should be kept in a\ngolden urn, and given to Cressida. Pandarus renewed his old\ncounsels and consolations, reminded his friend that ten days\nwere a short time to wait, argued against his faith in evil\ndreams, and urged him to take advantage of the truce, and\nbeguile the time by a visit to King Sarpedon (a Lycian Prince\nwho had come to aid the Trojans). Sarpedon entertained them\nsplendidly; but no feasting, no pomp, no music of instruments,\nno singing of fair ladies, could make up for the absence of\nCressida to the desolate Troilus, who was for ever poring upon\nher old letters, and recalling her loved form. Thus he \"drove to\nan end\" the fourth day, and would have then returned to Troy,\nbut for the remonstrances of Pandarus, who asked if they had\nvisited Sarpedon only to fetch fire? At last, at the end of a\nweek, they returned to Troy; Troilus hoping to find Cressida\nagain in the city, Pandarus entertaining a scepticism which he\nconcealed from his friend. The morning after their return,\nTroilus was impatient till he had gone to the palace of Cressida;\nbut when he found her doors all closed, \"well nigh for sorrow\nadown he gan to fall.\"\n\nTherewith, when he was ware, and gan behold\nHow shut was ev'ry window of the place,\nAs frost him thought his hearte *gan to cold;*      *began to grow cold*\nFor which, with changed deadly pale face,\nWithoute word, he forth began to pace;\nAnd, as God would, he gan so faste ride,\nThat no wight of his countenance espied.\n\nThen said he thus: \"O palace desolate!\nO house of houses, *whilom beste hight!*          *formerly called best*\nO palace empty and disconsolate!\nO thou lantern, of which quench'd is the light!\nO palace, whilom day, that now art night!\nWell oughtest thou to fall, and I to die,\nSince she is gone that wont was us to guy!*                 *guide, rule\n\n\"O palace, whilom crown of houses all,\nIllumined with sun of alle bliss!\nO ring, from which the ruby is out fall!\nO cause of woe, that cause hast been of bliss!\nYet, since I may no bet, fain would I kiss\nThy colde doores, durst I for this rout;\nAnd farewell shrine, of which the saint is out!\"\n\n.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .\n\nFrom thence forth he rideth up and down,\nAnd ev'ry thing came him to remembrance,\nAs he rode by the places of the town,\nIn which he whilom had all his pleasance;\n\"Lo! yonder saw I mine own lady dance;\nAnd in that temple, with her eyen clear,\nMe caughte first my righte lady dear.\n\n\"And yonder have I heard full lustily\nMy deare hearte laugh; and yonder play:\nSaw I her ones eke full blissfully;\nAnd yonder ones to me gan she say,\n'Now, goode sweete! love me well, I pray;'\nAnd yond so gladly gan she me behold,\nThat to the death my heart is to her hold.*               *holden, bound\n\n\"And at that corner, in the yonder house,\nHeard I mine allerlevest* lady dear,                     *dearest of all\nSo womanly, with voice melodious,\nSinge so well, so goodly and so clear,\nThat in my soule yet me thinks I hear\nThe blissful sound; and in that yonder place\nMy lady first me took unto her grace.\"\n\nThen he went to the gates, and gazed along the way by which\nhe had attended Cressida at her departure; then he fancied that\nall the passers-by pitied him; and thus he drove forth a day or\ntwo more, singing a song, of few words, which he had made to\nlighten his heart:\n\n\"O star, of which I lost have all the light,\nWith hearte sore well ought I to bewail,\nThat ever dark in torment, night by night,\nToward my death, with wind I steer and sail;\nFor which, the tenthe night, if that I fail*      *miss; be left without\nThe guiding of thy beames bright an hour,\nMy ship and me Charybdis will devour.\"\n\nBy night he prayed the moon to run fast about her sphere; by\nday he reproached the tardy sun -- dreading that Phaethon had\ncome to life again, and was driving the chariot of Apollo out of\nits straight course. Meanwhile Cressida, among the Greeks, was\nbewailing the refusal of her father to let her return, the certainty\nthat her lover would think her false, and the hopelessness of any\nattempt to steal away by night. Her bright face waxed pale, her\nlimbs lean, as she stood all day looking toward Troy; thinking\non her love and all her past delights, regretting that she had not\nfollowed the counsel of Troilus to steal away with him, and\nfinally vowing that she would at all hazards return to the city.\nBut she was fated, ere two months, to be full far from any such\nintention; for Diomede now brought all his skill into play, to\nentice Cressida into his net. On the tenth day, Diomede, \"as\nfresh as branch in May,\" came to the tent of Cressida, feigning\nbusiness with Calchas.\n\nCresside, at shorte wordes for to tell,\nWelcomed him, and down by her him set,\nAnd he was *eath enough to make dwell;*       *easily persuaded to stay*\nAnd after this, withoute longe let,*                              *delay\nThe spices and the wine men forth him fet,*                     *fetched\nAnd forth they speak of this and that y-fere,*                 *together\nAs friendes do, of which some shall ye hear.\n\nHe gan first fallen of the war in speech\nBetween them and the folk of Troye town,\nAnd of the siege he gan eke her beseech\nTo tell him what was her opinioun;\nFrom that demand he so descended down\nTo aske her, if that her strange thought\nThe Greekes' guise,* and workes that they wrought.              *fashion\n\nAnd why her father tarried* so long                             *delayed\nTo wedde her unto some worthy wight.\nCressida, that was in her paines strong\nFor love of Troilus, her owen knight,\nSo farforth as she cunning* had or might,                       *ability\nAnswer'd him then; but, as for his intent,*                     *purpose\nIt seemed not she wiste* what he meant.                            *knew\n\nBut natheless this ilke* Diomede                                   *same\nGan *in himself assure,* and thus he said;              *grow confident*\n\"If I aright have *taken on you heed,*                    *observed you*\nMe thinketh thus, O lady mine Cresside,\nThat since I first hand on your bridle laid,\nWhen ye out came of Troye by the morrow,\nNe might I never see you but in sorrow.\n\n\"I cannot say what may the cause be,\nBut if for love of some Trojan it were;\n*The which right sore would a-thinke me*            *which it would much\nThat ye for any wight that dwelleth there              pain me to think*\nShould [ever] spill* a quarter of a tear,                          *shed\nOr piteously yourselfe so beguile;*                             *deceive\nFor dreadeless* it is not worth the while.                  *undoubtedly\n\n\"The folk of Troy, as who saith, all and some\nIn prison be, as ye yourselfe see;\nFrom thence shall not one alive come\nFor all the gold betwixte sun and sea;\nTruste this well, and understande me;\nThere shall not one to mercy go alive,\nAll* were he lord of worldes twice five.                       *although\n\n.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .\n\n\"What will ye more, lovesome lady dear?\nLet Troy and Trojan from your hearte pace;\nDrive out that bitter hope, and make good cheer,\nAnd call again the beauty of your face,\nThat ye with salte teares so deface;\nFor Troy is brought into such jeopardy,\nThat it to save is now no remedy.\n\n\"And thinke well, ye shall in Greekes find\nA love more perfect, ere that it be night,\nThan any Trojan is, and more kind,\nAnd better you to serve will do his might;\nAnd, if ye vouchesafe, my lady bright,\nI will be he, to serve you, myselve, --\nYea, lever* than be a lord of Greekes twelve!\"                   *rather\n\nAnd with that word he gan to waxe red,\nAnd in his speech a little while he quoke,*            *quaked; trembled\nAnd cast aside a little with his head,\nAnd stint a while; and afterward he woke,\nAnd soberly on her he threw his look,\nAnd said, \"I am, albeit to you no joy,\nAs gentle* man as any wight in Troy.                          *high-born\n\n\"But, hearte mine! since that I am your man,*         *leigeman, subject\nAnd [you] be the first of whom I seeke grace,                  (in love)\nTo serve you as heartily as I can,\nAnd ever shall, while I to live have space,\nSo, ere that I depart out of this place,\nYe will me grante that I may, to-morrow,\nAt better leisure, telle you my sorrow.\"\n\nWhy should I tell his wordes that he said?\nHe spake enough for one day at the mest;*                          *most\nIt proveth well he spake so, that Cresseide\nGranted upon the morrow, at his request,\nFarther to speake with him, at the least,\nSo that he would not speak of such mattere;\nAnd thus she said to him, as ye may hear:\n\nAs she that had her heart on Troilus\nSo faste set, that none might it arace;*                    *uproot <83>\nAnd strangely* she spake, and saide thus;       *distantly, unfriendlily\n\"O Diomede!

The tenth day,\nmeantime, had barely dawned, when Troilus, accompanied by\nPandarus, took his stand on the walls, to watch for the return of\nCressida. Till noon they stood, thinking that every corner from\nafar was she; then Troilus said that doubtless her old father bore\nthe parting ill, and had detained her till after dinner; so they\nwent to dine, and returned to their vain observation on the\nwalls. Troilus invented all kinds of explanations for his\nmistress's delay; now, her father would not let her go till eve;\nnow, she would ride quietly into the town after nightfall, not to\nbe observed; now, he must have mistaken the day. For five or\nsix days he watched, still in vain, and with decreasing hope.\nGradually his strength decayed, until he could walk only with a\nstaff; answering the wondering inquiries of his friends, by saying\nthat he had a grievous malady about his heart. One day he\ndreamed that in a forest he saw Cressida in the embrace of a\nboar; and he had no longer doubt of her falsehood. Pandarus,\nhowever, explained away the dream to mean merely that\nCressida was detained by her father, who might be at the point\nof death; and he counselled the disconsolate lover to write a\nletter, by which he might perhaps get at the truth. Troilus\ncomplied, entreating from his mistress, at the least, a \"letter of\nhope;\" and the lady answered, that she could not come now, but\nwould so soon as she might; at the same time \"making him great\nfeast,\" and swearing that she loved him best -- \"of which he\nfound but bottomless behest [which he found but groundless\npromises].\" Day by day increased the woe of Troilus; he laid\nhimself in bed, neither eating, nor drinking, nor sleeping, nor\nspeaking, almost distracted by the thought of Cressida's\nunkindness. He related his dream to his sister Cassandra, who\ntold him that the boar betokened Diomede, and that,\nwheresoever his lady was, Diornede certainly had her heart, and\nshe was his: \"weep if thou wilt, or leave, for, out of doubt, this\nDiomede is in, and thou art out.\" Troilus, enraged, refused to\nbelieve Cassandra's interpretation; as well, he cried, might such\na story be credited of Alcestis, who devoted her life for her\nhusband; and in his wrath he started from bed, \"as though all\nwhole had him y-made a leach [physician],\" resolving to find\nout the truth at all hazards. The death of Hector meanwhile\nenhanced the sorrow which he endured; but he found time to\nwrite often to Cressida, beseeching her to come again and hold\nher truth; till one day his false mistress, out of pity, wrote him\nagain, in these terms:\n\n\"Cupide's son, ensample of goodlihead,*              *beauty, excellence\nO sword of knighthood, source of gentleness!\nHow might a wight in torment and in dread,\nAnd healeless,* you send as yet gladness?              *devoid of health\nI hearteless, I sick, I in distress?\nSince ye with me, nor I with you, may deal,\nYou neither send I may nor heart nor heal.\n\n\"Your letters full, the paper all y-plainted,*             *covered with\nCommoved have mine heart's pitt;                            complainings\nI have eke seen with teares all depainted\nYour letter, and how ye require me\nTo come again; the which yet may not be;\nBut why, lest that this letter founden were,\nNo mention I make now for fear.\n\n\"Grievous to me, God wot, is your unrest,\nYour haste,* and that the goddes' ordinance                  *impatience\nIt seemeth not ye take as for the best;\nNor other thing is in your remembrance,\nAs thinketh me, but only your pleasance;\nBut be not wroth, and that I you beseech,\nFor that I tarry is *all for wicked speech.*         *to avoid malicious\n                                                                 gossip*\n\"For I have heard well more than I wend*                *weened, thought\nTouching us two, how thinges have stood,\nWhich I shall with dissimuling amend;\nAnd, be not wroth, I have eke understood\nHow ye ne do but holde me on hand; <87>\nBut now *no force,* I cannot in you guess                    *no matter*\nBut alle truth and alle gentleness.\n\n\"Comen I will, but yet in such disjoint*             *jeopardy, critical\nI stande now, that what year or what day                        position\nThat this shall be, that can I not appoint;\nBut in effect I pray you, as I may,\nFor your good word and for your friendship ay;\nFor truely, while that my life may dure,\nAs for a friend, ye may *in me assure.*                   *depend on me*\n\n\"Yet pray I you, *on evil ye not take*              *do not take it ill*\nThat it is short, which that I to you write;\nI dare not, where I am, well letters make;\nNor never yet ne could I well endite;\nEke *great effect men write in place lite;*      *men write great matter\nTh' intent is all, and not the letter's space;          in little space*\nAnd fare now well, God have you in his grace!\n                           \"La Vostre C.\"\n\nThough he found this letter \"all strange,\" and thought it like \"a\nkalendes of change,\" <88> Troilus could not believe his lady so\ncruel as to forsake him; but he was put out of all doubt, one day\nthat, as he stood in suspicion and melancholy, he saw a \"coat-\narmour\" borne along the street, in token of victory, before\nDeiphobus his brother. Deiphobus had won it from Diomede in\nbattle that day; and Troilus, examining it out of curiosity, found\nwithin the collar a brooch which he had given to Cressida on the\nmorning she left Troy, and which she had pledged her faith to\nkeep for ever in remembrance of his sorrow and of him. At this\nfatal discovery of his lady's untruth,\n\nGreat was the sorrow and plaint of Troilus;\nBut forth her course Fortune ay gan to hold;\nCressida lov'd the son of Tydeus,\nAnd Troilus must weep in cares cold.\nSuch is the world, whoso it can behold!\nIn each estate is little hearte's rest;\nGod lend* us each to take it for the best!                        *grant\n\nIn many a cruel battle Troilus wrought havoc among the\nGreeks, and often he exchanged blows and bitter words with\nDiomede, whom he always specially sought; but it was not their\nlot that either should fall by the other's hand. The poet's\npurpose, however, he tells us, is to relate, not the warlike deeds\nof Troilus, which Dares has fully told, but his love-fortunes:\n\nBeseeching ev'ry lady bright of hue,\nAnd ev'ry gentle woman, *what she be,*               *whatsoever she be*\nAlbeit that Cressida was untrue,\nThat for that guilt ye be not wroth with me;\nYe may her guilt in other bookes see;\nAnd gladder I would writen, if you lest,\nOf Penelope's truth, and good Alceste.\n\nNor say I not this only all for men,\nBut most for women that betrayed be\nThrough false folk (God give them sorrow, Amen!)\nThat with their greate wit and subtilty\nBetraye you; and this commoveth me\nTo speak; and in effect you all I pray,\nBeware of men, and hearken what I say.\n\nGo, little book, go, little tragedy!\nThere God my maker, yet ere that I die,\nSo send me might to make some comedy!\nBut, little book, *no making thou envy,*  *be envious of no poetry* <89>\nBut subject be unto all poesy;\nAnd kiss the steps, where as thou seest space,\nOf Virgil, Ovid, Homer, Lucan, Stace.\n\nAnd, for there is so great diversity\nIn English, and in writing of our tongue,\nSo pray I God, that none miswrite thee,\nNor thee mismetre for default of tongue!\nAnd read whereso thou be, or elles sung,\nThat thou be understanden, God I 'seech!*                       *beseech\nBut yet to purpose of my *rather speech.*         *earlier subject* <90>\n\nThe wrath, as I began you for to say,\nOf Troilus the Greekes boughte dear;\nFor thousandes his handes *made dey,*                      *made to die*\nAs he that was withouten any peer,\nSave in his time Hector, as I can hear;\nBut, well-away!

The double sorrow: First his suffering before his love was\nsuccessful; and then his grief after his lady had been separated\nfrom him, and had proved unfaithful.\n\n2. Tisiphone: one of the Eumenides, or Furies, who avenged on\nmen in the next world the crimes committed on earth. Chaucer\nmakes this grim invocation most fitly, since the Trojans were\nunder the curse of the Eumenides, for their part in the offence\nof Paris in carrying off Helen, the wife of his host Menelaus,\nand thus impiously sinning against the laws of hospitality.\n\n3. See Chaucer's description of himself in \"The House Of\nFame,\" and note 11 to that poem.\n\n4. The Palladium, or image of Pallas (daughter of Triton and\nfoster-sister of Athena), was said to have fallen from heaven at\nTroy, where Ilus was just beginning to found the city; and Ilus\nerected a sanctuary, in which it was preserved with great\nhonour and care, since on its safety was supposed to depend the\nsafety of the city. In later times a Palladium was any statue of\nthe goddess Athena kept for the safeguard of the city that\npossessed it.\n\n5. \"Oh, very god!\": oh true divinity! -- addressing Cressida.\n\n6. Ascaunce: as if to say -- as much as to say. The word\nrepresents \"Quasi dicesse\" in Boccaccio. See note 5 to the\nSompnour's Tale.\n\n7. Eft: another reading is \"oft.\"\n\n8. Arten: constrain -- Latin, \"arceo.\"\n\n9. The song is a translation of Petrarch's 88th Sonnet, which\nopens thus:\n\"S'amor non e, che dunque e quel ch'i'sento.\"\n\n10. If maugre me: If (I burn) in spite of myself. The usual\nreading is, \"If harm agree me\" = if my hurt contents me: but\nevidently the antithesis is lost which Petrarch intended when,\nafter \"s'a mia voglia ardo,\" he wrote \"s'a mal mio grado\" = if\nagainst my will; and Urry's Glossary points out the probability\nthat in transcription the words \"If that maugre me\" may have\ngradually changed into \"If harm agre me.\"\n\n11. The Third of May seems either to have possessed peculiar\nfavour or significance with Chaucer personally, or to have had a\nspecial importance in connection with those May observances\nof which the poet so often speaks. It is on the third night of\nMay that Palamon, in The Knight's Tale, breaks out of prison,\nand at early morn encounters in the forest Arcita, who has gone\nforth to pluck a garland in honour of May; it is on the third\nnight of May that the poet hears the debate of \"The Cuckoo and\nthe Nightingale\"; and again in the present passage the favoured\ndate recurs.\n\n12. Went: turning; from Anglo-Saxon, \"wendan;\" German,\n\"wenden.\" The turning and tossing of uneasy lovers in bed is,\nwith Chaucer, a favourite symptom of their passion. See the\nfifth \"statute,\" in The Court of Love.\n\n13. Procne, daughter of Pandion, king of Attica, was given to\nwife to Tereus in reward for his aid against an enemy; but\nTereus dishonoured Philomela, Procne's sister; and his wife, in\nrevenge, served up to him the body of his own child by her.\nTereus, infuriated, pursued the two sisters, who prayed the\ngods to change them into birds. The prayer was granted;\nPhilomela became a nightingale, Procne a swallow, and Tereus\na hawk.\n\n14. Fished fair: a proverbial phrase which probably may be best\nrepresented by the phrase \"done great execution.\"\n\n15. The fair gem virtueless:  possessing none of the virtues\nwhich in the Middle Ages were universally believed to be\ninherent in precious stones.\n\n16. The crop and root: the most perfect example. See note 29\nto the Knight's Tale.\n\n17. Eme: uncle; the mother's brother; still used in Lancashire.\nAnglo-Saxon, \"eame;\" German, \"Oheim.\"\n\n18. Dardanus: the mythical ancestor of the Trojans, after whom\nthe gate is supposed to be called.\n\n19. All the other gates were secured with chains, for better\ndefence against the besiegers.\n\n20. Happy day:  good fortune; French, \"bonheur;\" both \"happy\nday\" and \"happy hour\" are borrowed from the astrological\nfiction about the influence of the time of birth.\n\n21. Horn, and nerve, and rind: The various layers or materials\nof the shield -- called boagrion in the Iliad -- which was made\nfrom the hide of the wild bull.\n\n22. His brother:  Hector.\n\n23. Who gives me drink?: Who has given me a love-potion, to\ncharm my heart thus away?\n\n24. That plaited she full oft in many a fold: She deliberated\ncarefully, with many arguments this way and that.\n\n25. Through which I mighte stand in worse plight: in a worse\nposition in the city; since she might through his anger lose the\nprotection of his brother Hector.\n\n26. I am not religious: I am not in holy vows. See the complaint\nof the nuns in \"The Court of Love.\"\n\n27. The line recalls Milton's \"dark with excessive bright.\"\n\n28. No weal is worth, that may no sorrow drien: the meaning is,\nthat whosoever cannot endure sorrow deserves not happiness.\n\n29. French, \"verre;\" glass.\n\n30. From cast of stones ware him in the werre: let him beware\nof casting stones in battle. The proverb in its modern form\nwarns those who live in glass houses of the folly of throwing\nstones.\n\n31. Westren:  to west or wester -- to decline towards the west;\nso Milton speaks of the morning star as sloping towards\nheaven's descent \"his westering wheel.\"\n\n32. A pike with ass's feet etc.: this is merely another version of\nthe well-known example of incongruity that opens the \"Ars\nPoetica\" of Horace.\n\n33. Tristre: tryst; a preconcerted spot to which the beaters\ndrove the game, and at which the sportsmen waited with their\nbows.\n\n34. A kankerdort: a condition or fit of perplexed anxiety;\nprobably connected with the word \"kink\" meaning in sea phrase\na twist in an rope -- and, as a verb, to twist or entangle.\n\n35. They feel in times, with vapour etern: they feel in their\nseasons, by the emission of an eternal breath or inspiration (that\nGod loves, &c.)\n\n36. The idea of this stanza is the same with that developed in\nthe speech of Theseus at the close of The Knight's Tale; and it is\nprobably derived from the lines of Boethius, quoted in note 91\nto that Tale.\n\n37. In this and the following lines reappears the noble doctrine\nof the exalting and purifying influence of true love, advanced in\n\"The Court of Love,\" \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale,\" &c.\n\n38. Weir: a trap or enclosed place in a stream, for catching fish.\nSee note 10 to The Assembly of Fowls.\n\n39. Nor might one word for shame to it say: nor could he\nanswer one word for shame (at the stratagem that brought\nCressida to implore his protection)\n\n40. \"All n'ere he malapert, nor made avow\n     Nor was so bold to sing a foole's mass;\"\ni.e. although he was not over-forward and made no confession\n(of his love), or was so bold as to be rash and ill-advised in his\ndeclarations of love and worship.\n\n41. Pandarus wept as if he would turn to water; so, in The\nSquire's Tale, did Canace weep for the woes of the falcon.\n\n42. If I breake your defence: if I transgress in whatever you may\nforbid; French, \"defendre,\" to prohibit.\n\n43. These lines and the succeeding stanza are addressed to\nPandarus, who had interposed some words of incitement to\nCressida.\n\n44.  In \"The Court of Love,\" the poet says of Avaunter, that\n\"his ancestry of kin was to Lier; and the stanza in which that\nline occurs  expresses precisely the same idea as in the text.\nVain boasters  of ladies' favours are also satirised in \"The House\nof Fame\".\n\n45. Nice:  silly, stupid; French, \"niais.\"\n\n46.\"Reheating\" is read by preference for \"richesse,\" which\nstands in the older printed editions; though \"richesse\" certainly\nbetter represents the word used in the original of Boccaccio --\n\"dovizia,\" meaning abundance or wealth.\n\n47. \"Depart it so, for widewhere is wist\n     How that there is diversity requer'd\n     Betwixte thinges like, as I have lear'd:\"\ni.e. make this distinction, for it is universally known that there is\na great difference between things that seem the same, as I have\nlearned.\n\n48. Frepe: the set, or company; French, \"frappe,\" a stamp (on\ncoins), a set (of moulds).\n\n49. To be \"in the wind\" of noisy magpies, or other birds that\nmight spoil sport by alarming the game, was not less desirable\nthan to be on the \"lee-side\" of the game itself, that the hunter's\npresence might not be betrayed by the scent. \"In the wind of,\"\nthus signifies not to windward of, but to leeward of -- that is, in\nthe wind that comes from the object of pursuit.\n\n50. Bothe fremd and tame: both foes and friends -- literally,\nboth wild and tame, the sporting metaphor being sustained.\n\n51. The lovers are supposed to say, that nothing is wanting but\nto know the time at which they should meet.\n\n52. A  tale of Wade: see note 5 to the Merchant's Tale.\n\n53. Saturn, and Jove, in Cancer joined were: a conjunction that\nimported rain.\n\n54. Smoky rain: An admirably graphic description of dense rain.\n\n55. For the force of \"cold,\" see note 22 to the Nun's Priest's\nTale.\n\n56. Goddes seven:  The divinities who gave their names to the\nseven planets, which, in association with the seven metals, are\nmentioned in The Canon's Yeoman's Tale.\n\n57. Assayed:  experienced, tasted. See note 6 to the Squire's\nTale.\n\n58. Now is it better than both two were lorn: better this happy\nissue, than that both two should be lost (through the sorrow of\nfruitless love).\n\n59. Made him such feast: French, \"lui fit fete\" -- made holiday\nfor him.\n\n60. The cock is called, in \"The Assembly of Fowls,\" \"the\nhorologe of thorpes lite;\" [the clock of little villages] and in The\nNun's Priest's Tale Chanticleer knew by nature each ascension\nof the equinoctial, and, when the sun had ascended fifteen\ndegrees, \"then crew he, that it might not be amended.\" Here he\nis termed the \"common astrologer,\" as employing for the public\nadvantage his knowledge of astronomy.\n\n61. Fortuna Major: the planet Jupiter.\n\n62. When Jupiter visited Alcmena in the form of her husband\nAmphitryon, he is said to have prolonged the night to the length\nof three natural nights. Hercules was the fruit of the union.\n\n63. Chaucer seems to confound Titan, the title of the sun, with\nTithonus (or Tithon, as contracted in poetry), whose couch\nAurora was wont to share.\n\n64. So, in \"Locksley Hall,\" Tennyson says that \"a sorrow's\ncrown of sorrow is rememb'ring better things.\" The original is in\nDante's words:- -\n\"Nessun maggior dolore\n Che ricordarsi del tempo felice\n Nella miseria.\" -- \"Inferno,\" v. 121.\n(\"There is no greater sorrow than to remember happy times\nwhen in misery\")\n\n65. As great a craft is to keep weal as win: it needs as much\nskill to keep prosperity as to attain it.\n\n66. To heap: together. See the reference to Boethius in note 91\nto the Knight's Tale.\n\n67. The smalle beastes let he go beside: a charming touch,\nindicative of the noble and generous inspiration of his love.\n\n68. Mew: the cage or chamber in which hawks were kept and\ncarefully tended during the moulting season.\n\n69. Love of steel:  love as true as steel.\n\n70. Pandarus, as it repeatedly appears, was an unsucsessful\nlover.\n\n71. \"Each for his virtue holden is full dear,\n     Both heroner, and falcon for rivere\":--\nThat is, each is esteemed for a special virtue or faculty, as the\nlarge gerfalcon for the chase of heron, the smaller goshawk for\nthe chase of river fowl.\n\n72. Zausis: An author of whom no record survives.\n\n73. And upon new case lieth new advice:  new counsels must be\nadopted as new circumstances arise.\n\n74. Hid in mew: hidden in a place remote from the world -- of\nwhich Pandarus thus betrays ignorance.\n\n75. The modern phrase \"sixes and sevens,\" means \"in\nconfusion:\" but here the idea of gaming perhaps suits the sense\nbetter -- \"set the world upon a cast of the dice.\"\n\n76. The controversy between those who maintained the doctrine\nof predestination and those who held that of free-will raged\nwith no less animation at Chaucer's day, and before it, than it\nhas done in the subsequent five centuries; the Dominicans\nupholding the sterner creed, the Franciscans taking the other\nside. Chaucer has more briefly, and with the same care not to\ncommit himself, referred to the discussion in The Nun's Priest's\nTale.\n\n77. That have their top full high and smooth y-shore: that are\neminent among the clergy, who wear the tonsure.\n\n78. Athamante: Athamas, son of Aeolus; who, seized with\nmadness, under the wrath of Juno for his neglect of his wife\nNephele, slew his son Learchus.\n\n79. Simois:  one of the rivers of the Troad, flowing into the\nXanthus.\n\n80. Troilus was the son of Priam and Hecuba.\n\n81. The son of Tydeus:  Diomedes; far oftener called Tydides,\nafter his father Tydeus, king of Argos.\n\n82. Couthe more than the creed:  knew more than the mere\nelements (of the science of Love).\n\n83. Arache: wrench away, unroot (French, \"arracher\"); the\nopposite of \"enrace,\" to root in, implant.\n\n84. It will be remembered that, at the beginning of the first\nbook, Cressida is introduced to us as a widow.\n\n85. Diomede is called \"sudden,\" for the unexpectedness of his\nassault on Cressida's heart -- or, perhaps, for the abrupt\nabandonment of his indifference to love.\n\n86. Penscel:  a pennon or pendant; French, \"penoncel.\" It  was\nthe custom in chivalric times for a knight to wear, on days of\ntournament or in battle, some such token of his lady's favour, or\nbadge of his service to her.\n\n87. She has been told that Troilus is deceiving her.\n\n88. The Roman kalends were the first day of the month, when a\nchange of weather was usually expected.\n\n89. Maker, and making, words used in the Middle Ages to\nsignify the composer and the composition of poetry, correspond\nexactly with the Greek \"poietes\" and \"poiema,\" from \"poieo,\" I\nmake.\n\n90. My rather speech:  my earlier, former subject; \"rather\" is the\ncormparative of the old adjective \"rath,\" early.\n\n91. Up to the hollowness of the seventh sphere: passing up\nthrough the hollowness or concavity of the spheres, which all\nrevolve round each other and are all contained by God (see note\n5 to the Assembly of Fowls), the soul of Troilus, looking\ndownward, beholds the converse or convex side of the spheres\nwhich it has traversed.\n\n92. Sorted: allotted; from Latin, \"sors,\" lot, fortune.\n\n93. Rascaille: rabble; French, \"racaille\" -- a mob or multitude,\nthe riff-raff; so Spencer speaks of the \"rascal routs\" of inferior\ncombatants.\n\n94. John Gower, the poet, a contemporary and friend of\nChaucer's; author, among other works, of the \"Confessio\nAmantis.\" See note 1 to the Man of Law's Tale.\n\n95. Strode was an eminent scholar of Merton College, Oxford,\nand tutor to Chaucer's son Lewis.\n\n96. Explicit Liber Troili et Cresseidis: \"The end of the book of\nTroilus and Cressida.\"\n\n\n\nCHAUCER'S DREAM.\n\n\n[This pretty allegory, or rather conceit, containing one or two\npassages that for vividness and for delicacy yield to nothing in\nthe whole range of Chaucer's poetry, had never been printed\nbefore the year 1597, when it was included in the edition of\nSpeght. Before that date, indeed, a Dream of Chaucer had been\nprinted; but the poem so described was in reality \"The Book of\nthe Duchess; or the Death of Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster\" --\nwhich is not included in the present edition. Speght says that\n\"This Dream, devised by Chaucer, seemeth to be a covert report\nof the marriage of John of Gaunt, the King's son, with Blanche,\nthe daughter of Henry, Duke of Lancaster; who after long love\n(during the time whereof the poet feigneth them to be dead)\nwere in the end, by consent of friends, happily married; figured\nby a bird bringing in his bill an herb, which restored them to life\nagain. Here also is showed Chaucer's match with a certain\ngentlewoman, who, although she was a stranger, was,\nnotwithstanding, so well liked and loved of the Lady Blanche\nand her Lord, as Chaucer himself also was, that gladly they\nconcluded a marriage between them.\" John of Gaunt, at the age\nof nineteen, and while yet Earl of Richmond, was married to the\nLady Blanche at Reading in May 1359; Chaucer, then a prisoner\nin France, probably did not return to England till peace was\nconcluded in the following year; so that his marriage to Philippa\nRoet, the sister of the Duchess Blanche's favourite attendant\nKatharine Roet, could not have taken place till some time after\nthat of the Duke. In the poem, it is represented to have\nimmediately followed; but no consequence need be attached to\nthat statement. Enough that it followed at no great interval of\ntime; and that the intimate relations which Chaucer had already\nbegun to form with John of Gaunt, might well warrant him in\nwriting this poem on the occasion of the Duke's marriage, and\nin weaving his own love-fortunes with those of the principal\nfigures. In the necessary abridgement of the poem for the\npresent edition, the subsidiary branch of the allegory, relating to\nthe poet's own love affair, has been so far as possible separated\nfrom the main branch, which shadows forth the fortunes of John\nand Blanche. The poem, in full, contains, with an \"Envoy\"\narbitrarily appended, 2233 lines; of which 510 are given here.]\n(Transcriber's note: modern scholars believe that Chaucer was\nnot the author of this poem)\n\n\nWHEN Flora, the queen of pleasance,\nHad wholly *achiev'd the obeisance*                  *won the obedience*\nOf the fresh and the new season,\nThorough ev'ry region;\nAnd with her mantle *whole covert*                      *wholly covered*\nWhat winter had *made discovert,* --                          *stripped*\n\nOn a May night, the poet lay alone, thinking of his lady, and all\nher beauty; and, falling asleep, he dreamed that he was in an\nisland\n\nWhere wall, and gate, was all of glass,\nAnd so was closed round about,\nThat leaveless* none came in nor out;                *without permission\nUncouth and strange to behold;\nFor ev'ry gate, of fine gold,\nA thousand fanes,* ay turning,                      *vanes, weathercocks\nEntuned* had, and birds singing                 *contrived so as to emit\nDiversely, on each fane a pair,                          a musical sound\nWith open mouth, against the air; <1>\nAnd *of a suit* were all the tow'rs,                  *of the same plan*\nSubtilly *carven aft* flow'rs                      *carved to represent*\nOf uncouth colours, *during ay,*                       *lasting forever*\nThat never be none seen in May,\nWith many a small turret high;\nBut man alive I could not sigh,*                                    *see\nNor creatures, save ladies play,*                 *disporting themselves\nWhich were such of their array,\nThat, as me thought, *of goodlihead*                    *for comeliness*\nThey passed all, and womanhead.\nFor to behold them dance and sing,\nIt seemed like none earthly thing;\n\nAnd all were of the same age, save one; who was advanced in\nyears, though no less gay in demeanour than the rest. While he\nstood admiring the richness and beauty of the place, and the\nfairness of the ladies, which had the notable gift of enduring\nunimpaired till death, the poet was accosted by the old lady, to\nwhom he had to yield himself prisoner; because the ordinance of\nthe isle was, that no man should dwell there; and the ladies' fear\nof breaking the law was enhanced by the temporary absence of\ntheir queen from the realm. Just at this moment the cry was\nraised that the queen came; all the ladies hastened to meet her;\nand soon the poet saw her approach -- but in her company his\nmistress, wearing the same garb, and a seemly knight. All the\nladies wondered greatly at this; and the queen explained:\n\n\"My sisters, how it hath befall,*                              *befallen\nI trow ye know it one and all,\nThat of long time here have I been\nWithin this isle biding as queen,\nLiving at ease, that never wight\nMore perfect joye have not might;\nAnd to you been of governance\nSuch as you found in whole pleasance, <2>\nIn every thing as ye know,\nAfter our custom and our law;\nWhich how they firste founded were,\nI trow ye wot all the mannere.\nAnd who the queen is of this isle, --\nAs I have been this longe while, --\nEach seven years must, of usage,\nVisit the heav'nly hermitage,\nWhich on a rock so highe stands,\nIn a strange sea, out from all lands,\nThat for to make the pilgrimage\nIs call'd a perilous voyage;\nFor if the wind be not good friend,\nThe journey dureth to the end\nOf him which that it undertakes;\nOf twenty thousand not one scapes.\nUpon which rock groweth a tree,\nThat certain years bears apples three;\nWhich three apples whoso may have,\nIs *from all displeasance y-save*                   *safe from all pain*\nThat in the seven years may fall;\nThis wot you well, both one and all.\nFor the first apple and the hext,*                          *highest <3>\nWhich groweth unto you the next,\nHath three virtues notable,\nAnd keepeth youth ay durable,\nBeauty, and looks, ever-in-one,*                            *continually\nAnd is the best of ev'ry one.\nThe second apple, red and green,\nOnly with lookes of your eyne,\nYou nourishes in great pleasance,\nBetter than partridge or fesaunce,*                            *pheasant\nAnd feedeth ev'ry living wight\nPleasantly, only with the sight.\nAnd the third apple of the three,\nWhich groweth lowest on the tree,\nWhoso it beareth may not fail*                     *miss, fail to obtain\nThat* to his pleasance may avail.                            *that which\nSo your pleasure and beauty rich,\nYour during youth ever y-lich,*                                   *alike\nYour truth, your cunning,* and your weal,                     *knowledge\nHath flower'd ay, and your good heal,\nWithout sickness or displeasance,\nOr thing that to you was noyance.*                      *offence, injury\nSo that you have as goddesses\nLived above all princesses.\nNow is befall'n, as ye may see;\nTo gather these said apples three,\nI have not fail'd, against the day,\nThitherward to take the way,\n*Weening to speed* as I had oft.                  *expecting to succeed*\nBut when I came, I found aloft\nMy sister, which that hero stands,\nHaving those apples in her hands,\nAdvising* them, and nothing said,                  *regarding, gazing on\nBut look'd as she were *well apaid:*                         *satisfied*\nAnd as I stood her to behold,\nThinking how my joys were cold,\nSince I these apples *have not might,*                  *might not have*\nEven with that so came this knight,\nAnd in his arms, of me unware,\nMe took, and to his ship me bare,\nAnd said, though him I ne'er had seen,\nYet had I long his lady been;\nWherefore I shoulde with him wend,\nAnd he would, to his life's end,\nMy servant be; and gan to sing,\nAs one that had won a rich thing.\nThen were my spirits from me gone,\nSo suddenly every one,\nThat in me appear'd but death,\nFor I felt neither life nor breath,\nNor good nor harme none I knew,\nThe sudden pain me was so new,\nThat *had not the hasty grace be*               *had it not been for the\nOf this lady, that from the tree                        prompt kindness*\nOf her gentleness so bled,*                                    *hastened\nMe to comforten, I had died;\nAnd of her three apples she one\nInto mine hand there put anon,\nWhich brought again my mind and breath,\nAnd me recover'd from the death.\nWherefore to her so am I hold,*                       *beholden, obliged\nThat for her all things do I wo'ld,\nFor she was leach* of all my smart,                           *physician\nAnd from great pain so quit* my heart.                        *delivered\nAnd as God wot, right as ye hear,\nMe to comfort with friendly cheer,\nShe did her prowess and her might.\nAnd truly eke so did this knight,\nIn that he could; and often said,\nThat of my woe he was *ill paid,*              *distressed, ill-pleased*\nAnd curs'd the ship that him there brought,\nThe mast, the master that it wrought.\nAnd, as each thing must have an end,\nMy sister here, our bother friend, <4>\nGan with her words so womanly\nThis knight entreat, and cunningly,\nFor mine honour and hers also,\nAnd said that with her we should go\nBoth in her ship, where she was brought,\nWhich was so wonderfully wrought,\nSo clean, so rich, and so array'd,\nThat we were both content and paid;*                          *satisfied\nAnd me to comfort and to please,\nAnd my heart for to put at ease,\nShe took great pain in little while,\nAnd thus hath brought us to this isle\nAs ye may see; wherefore each one\nI pray you thank her one and one,\nAs heartily as ye can devise,\nOr imagine in any wise.\"\n\nAt once there then men mighte see'n,\nA world of ladies fall on kneen\nBefore my lady, --\n\nThanking her, and placing themselves at her commandment.\nThen the queen sent the aged lady to the knight, to learn of him\nwhy he had done her all this woe; and when the messenger had\ndischarged her mission, telling the knight that in the general\nopinion he had done amiss, he fell down suddenly as if dead for\nsorrow and repentance. Only with great difficulty, by the queen\nherself, was he restored to consciousness and comfort; but\nthough she spoke kind and hope-inspiring words, her heart was\nnot in her speech,\n\nFor her intent was, to his barge\nHim for to bring against the eve,\nWith certain ladies, and take leave,\nAnd pray him, of his gentleness,\nTo *suffer her* thenceforth in peace,                    *let her dwell*\nAs other princes had before;\nAnd from thenceforth, for evermore,\nShe would him worship in all wise\nThat gentlenesse might devise;\nAnd *pain her* wholly to fulfil,               *make her utmost efforts*\nIn honour, his pleasure and will.\n\nAnd during thus this knighte's woe, --\nPresent* the queen and other mo',                *(there being) present*\nMy lady and many another wight, --\nTen thousand shippes at a sight\nI saw come o'er the wavy flood,\nWith sail and oar; that, as I stood\nThem to behold, I gan marvail\nFrom whom might come so many a sail;\nFor, since the time that I was born,\nSuch a navy therebeforn\nHad I not seen, nor so array'd,\nThat for the sight my hearte play'd\nAy to and fro within my breast;\nFor joy long was ere it would rest.\nFor there were sailes *full of flow'rs;*      *embroidered with flowers*\nAfter, castles with huge tow'rs, <5>\nSeeming full of armes bright,\nThat wond'rous lusty* was the sight;                           *pleasant\nWith large tops, and mastes long,\nRichly depaint' and *rear'd among.*                  *raised among them*\nAt certain times gan repair\nSmalle birdes down from the air,\nAnd on the shippes' bounds* about                              *bulwarks\nSat and sang, with voice full out,\nBallads and lays right joyously,\nAs they could in their harmony.\n\nThe ladies were alarmed and sorrow-stricken at sight of the\nships, thinking that the knight's companions were on board; and\nthey went towards the walls of the isle, to shut the gates. But it\nwas Cupid who came; and he had already landed, and marched\nstraight to the place where the knight lay. Then he chid the\nqueen for her unkindness to his servant; shot an arrow into her\nheart; and passed through the crowd, until he found the poet's\nlady, whom he saluted and complimented, urging her to have\npity on him that loved her. While the poet, standing apart, was\nrevolving all this in his mind, and resolving truly to serve his\nlady, he saw the queen advance to Cupid, with a petition in\nwhich she besought forgiveness of past offences, and promised\ncontinual and zealous service till her death. Cupid smiled, and\nsaid that he would be king within that island, his new conquest;\nthen, after long conference with the queen, he called a council\nfor the morrow, of all who chose to wear his colours. In the\nmorning, such was the press of ladies, that scarcely could\nstanding-room be found in all the plain. Cupid presided; and one\nof his counsellors addressed the mighty crowd, promising that\nere his departure his lord should bring to an agreement all the\nparties there present. Then Cupid gave to the knight and the\ndreamer each his lady; promised his favour to all the others in\nthat place who would truly and busily serve in love; and at\nevening took his departure. Next morning, having declined the\nproffered sovereignty of the island, the poet's mistress also\nembarked, leaving him behind; but he dashed through the\nwaves, was drawn on board her ship from peril of death, and\ngraciously received into his lady's lasting favour. Here the poet\nawakes, finding his cheeks and body all wet with tears; and,\nremoving into another chamber, to rest more in peace, he falls\nasleep anew, and continues the dream. Again he is within the\nisland, where the knight and all the ladies are assembled on a\ngreen, and it is resolved by the assembly, not only that the\nknight shall be their king, but that every lady there shall be\nwedded also. It is determined that the knight shall depart that\nvery day, and return, within ten days, with such a host of\nBenedicts, that none in the isle need lack husbands. The knight\n\nAnon into a little barge\nBrought was, late against an eve,\nWhere of all he took his leave.\nWhich barge was, as a man thought,\nAft* his pleasure to him brought;                         *according to*\nThe queen herself accustom'd ay\nIn the same barge to play.*                              *take her sport\nIt needed neither mast nor rother*                               *rudder\n(I have not heard of such another),\nNor master for the governance;*                                *steering\nIt sailed by thought and pleasance,\nWithoute labour, east and west;\nAll was one, calm or tempest. <6>\nAnd I went with, at his request,\nAnd was the first pray'd to the feast.*                *the bridal feast\nWhen he came unto his country,\nAnd passed had the wavy sea,\nIn a haven deep and large\nHe left his rich and noble barge,\nAnd to the court, shortly to tell,\nHe went, where he was wont to dwell, --\n\nAnd was gladly received as king by the estates of the land; for\nduring his absence his father, \"old, and wise, and hoar,\" had\ndied, commending to their fidelity his absent son. The prince\nrelated to the estates his journey, and his success in finding the\nprincess in quest of whom he had gone seven years before; and\nsaid that he must have sixty thousand guests at his marriage\nfeast. The lords gladly guaranteed the number within the set\ntime; but afterwards they found that fifteen days must be spent\nin the necessary preparations. Between shame and sorrow, the\nprince, thus compelled to break his faith, took to his bed, and,\nin wailing and self-reproach,\n\n-- Endur'd the days fifteen,\nTill that the lords, on an evene,*                              *evening\nHim came and told they ready were,\nAnd showed in few wordes there,\nHow and what wise they had *purvey'd                  *provided suitably\nFor his estate,* and to him said,                           to his rank*\nThat twenty thousand knights of name,\nAnd forty thousand without blame,\nAlle come of noble ligne*                                 *line, lineage\nTogether in a company\nWere lodged on a river's side,\nHim and his pleasure there t'abide.\nThe prince then for joy uprose,\nAnd, where they lodged were, he goes,\nWithoute more, that same night,\nAnd there his supper *made to dight;*                     *had prepared*\nAnd with them bode* till it was day.                     *abode, waited*\nAnd forthwith to take his journey,\nLeaving the strait, holding the large,\nTill he came to his noble barge:\nAnd when the prince, this lusty knight,\nWith his people in armes bright,\nWas come where he thought to pass,*                   *cross to the isle\nAnd knew well none abiding was\nBehind, but all were there present,\nForthwith anon all his intent\nHe told them there, and made his cries*                    *proclamation\nThorough his hoste that day twice,\nCommanding ev'ry living wight\nThere being present in his sight,\nTo be the morrow on the rivage,*                                  *shore\nThere he begin would his voyage.\n\nThe morrow come, the *cry was kept*            *proclamation was obeyed*\nBut few were there that night that slept,\nBut *truss'd and purvey'd* for the morrow;      *packed up and provided*\nFor fault* of ships was all their sorrow;                *lack, shortage\nFor, save the barge, and other two,\nOf shippes there I saw no mo'.\nThus in their doubtes as they stood,\nWaxing the sea, coming the flood,\nWas cried \"To ship go ev'ry wight!\"\nThen was but *hie that hie him might,*       *whoever could hasten, did*\nAnd to the barge, me thought, each one\nThey went, without was left not one,\nHorse, nor male*, truss, nor baggage,                     *trunk, wallet\nSalad*, spear, gardebrace,** nor page,        *helmet<7> **arm-shield<8>\nBut was lodged and room enough;\nAt which shipping me thought I lough,*                          *laughed\nAnd gan to marvel in my thought,\nHow ever such a ship was wrought.*                          *constructed\nFor *what people that can increase,*     *however the numbers increased*\nNor ne'er so thick might be the prease,*                   *press, crowd\nBut alle hadde room at will;\nThere was not one was lodged ill.\nFor, as I trow, myself the last\nWas one, and lodged by the mast;\nAnd where I look'd I saw such room\nAs all were lodged in a town.\nForth went the ship, said was the creed;<9>\nAnd on their knees, *for their good speed,*        *to pray for success*\nDown kneeled ev'ry wight a while,\nAnd prayed fast that to the isle\nThey mighte come in safety,\nThe prince and all the company.\nWith worship and withoute blame,\nOr disclander* of his name,                           *reproach, slander\nOf the promise he should return\nWithin the time he did sojourn\nIn his lande biding* his host;                              *waiting for\nThis was their prayer least and most:\nTo keep the day it might not be'n,\nThat he appointed with the queen.\n\nWherefore the prince slept neither day nor night, till he and his\npeople landed on the glass-walled isle, \"weening to be in heav'n\nthat night.\" But ere they had gone a little way, they met a lady\nall in black, with piteous countenance, who reproached the\nprince for his untruth, and informed him that, unable to bear the\nreproach to their name, caused by the lightness of their trust in\nstrangers, the queen and all the ladies of the isle had vowed\nneither to eat, nor drink, nor sleep, nor speak, nor cease\nweeping till all were dead. The queen had died the first; and half\nof the other ladies had already \"under the earth ta'en lodging\nnew.\" The woeful recorder of all these woes invites the prince\nto behold the queen's hearse:\n\n\"Come within, come see her hearse\nWhere ye shall see the piteous sight\nThat ever yet was shown to knight;\nFor ye shall see ladies stand,\nEach with a greate rod in hand,\nClad in black, with visage white,\nReady each other for to smite,\nIf any be that will not weep;\nOr who makes countenance to sleep.\nThey be so beat, that all so blue\nThey be as cloth that dy'd is new.\"\n\nScarcely has the lady ceased to speak, when the prince plucks\nforth a dagger, plunges it into his heart, and, drawing but one\nbreath, expires.\n\nFor whiche cause the lusty host,\nWhich [stood] in battle on the coast,\nAt once for sorrow such a cry\nGan rear, thorough* the company,                             *throughout\nThat to the heav'n heard was the soun',\nAnd under th'earth as far adown,\nAnd wilde beastes for the fear\nSo suddenly affrayed* were,                                      *afraid\nThat for the doubt, while they might dure,*     *have a chance of safety\nThey ran as of their lives unsure,\nFrom the woodes into the plain,\nAnd from valleys the high mountain\nThey sought, and ran as beastes blind,\nThat clean forgotten had their kind.*                            *nature\n\nThe lords of the laggard host ask the woebegone lady what\nshould be done; she answers that nothing can now avail, but\nthat for remembrance they should build in their land, open to\npublic view, \"in some notable old city,\" a chapel engraved with\nsome memorial of the queen. And straightway, with a sigh, she\nalso \"pass'd her breath.\"\n\nThen said the lordes of the host,\nAnd so concluded least and most,\nThat they would ay in houses of thack*                           *thatch\nTheir lives lead, <10> and wear but black,\nAnd forsake all their pleasances,\nAnd turn all joy to penances;\nAnd bare the dead prince to the barge,\nAnd named *them should* have the charge;              *those who should*\nAnd to the hearse where lay the queen\nThe remnant went, and down on kneen,\nHolding their hands on high, gan cry,\n\"Mercy! mercy!\" *evereach thry;*                       *each one thrice*\nAnd curs'd the time that ever sloth\nShould have such masterdom of troth.\nAnd to the barge, a longe mile,\nThey bare her forth; and, in a while,\nAll the ladies, one and one,\nBy companies were brought each one.\nAnd pass'd the sea, and took the land,\nAnd in new hearses, on a sand,\nPut and brought were all anon,\nUnto a city clos'd with stone,\nWhere it had been used ay\nThe kinges of the land to lay,\nAfter they reigned in honours;\nAnd writ was which were conquerours;\nIn an abbey of nunnes black,\nWhich accustom'd were to wake,\nAnd of usage rise each a-night,\nTo pray for ev'ry living wight.\nAnd so befell, as is the guise,\nOrdain'd and said was the service\nOf the prince and eke of the queen,\nSo devoutly as mighte be'n;\nAnd, after that, about the hearses,\nMany orisons and verses,\nWithoute note* <11> full softely                                  *music\nSaid were, and that full heartily;\nThat all the night, till it was day,\nThe people in the church gan pray\nUnto the Holy Trinity,\nOf those soules to have pity.\n\nAnd when the nighte past and run\nWas, and the newe day begun, --\nThe young morrow with rayes red,\nWhich from the sun all o'er gan spread,\nAttemper'd* cleare was and fair,                          *clement, calm\nAnd made a time of wholesome air, --\nBefell a wondrous case* and strange                       *chance, event\nAmong the people, and gan change\nSoon the word, and ev'ry woe\nUnto a joy, and some to two.\n\nA bird, all feather'd blue and green,\nWith brighte rays like gold between,\nAs small thread over ev'ry joint,\nAll full of colour strange and coint,*                           *quaint\nUncouth* and wonderful to sight,                             *unfamiliar\nUpon the queene's hearse gan light,\nAnd sung full low and softely\nThree songes in their harmony,\n*Unletted of* every wight;

and gan rehearse\nEach one to other what they had seen.\nAnd, *taling thus,* the seed wax'd green,             *as they gossiped*\nAnd on the dry hearse gan to spring, --\nWhich me thought was a wondrous thing, --\nAnd, after that, flow'r and new seed;\nOf which the people all took heed,\nAnd said it was some great miracle,\nOr medicine fine more than treacle;  <12>\nAnd were well done there to assay\nIf it might ease, in any way,\nThe corpses, which with torchelight\nThey waked had there all that night.\nSoon did the lordes there consent,\nAnd all the people thereto content,\nWith easy words and little fare;*                          *ado, trouble\nAnd made the queene's visage bare,\nWhich showed was to all about,\nWherefore in swoon fell all the rout,*                   *company, crowd\nAnd were so sorry, most and least,\nThat long of weeping they not ceas'd;\nFor of their lord the remembrance\nUnto them was such displeasance.*                        *cause of grief\nThat for to live they called pain,\nSo were they very true and plain.\nAnd after this the good abbess\nOf the grains gan choose and dress*                             *prepare\nThree, with her fingers clean and smale,*                         *small\nAnd in the queenes mouth, by tale,\nOne after other, full easily\nShe put, and eke full cunningly.*                             *skilfully\nWhich showed some such virtue.\nThat proved was the medicine true.\nFor with a smiling countenance\nThe queen uprose, and of usance*                                 *custom\nAs she was wont, to ev'ry wight\nShe *made good cheer;* for whiche sight               *showed a gracious\nThe people, kneeling on the stones,                         countenance*\nThought they in heav'n were, soul and bones;\nAnd to the prince, where that he lay,\nThey went to make the same assay.*                    *trial, experiment\nAnd when the queen it understood,\nAnd how the medicine was good,\nShe pray'd that she might have the grains,\nTo relieve him from the pains\nWhich she and he had both endur'd.\nAnd to him went, and so him cur'd,\nThat, within a little space,\nLusty and fresh alive he was,\nAnd in good heal, and whole of speech,\nAnd laugh'd, and said, *\"Gramercy, leach!\"*              *\"Great thanks,\nFor which the joy throughout the town                    my physician!\"*\nSo great was, that the belles' soun'\nAffray'd the people a journey*                       *to the distance of\nAbout the city ev'ry way;                               a day's journey*\nAnd came and ask'd the cause, and why\nThey rungen were so stately.*                         *proudly, solemnly\nAnd after that the queen, th'abbess,\nMade diligence, <14> ere they would cease,\nSuch, that of ladies soon a rout*                        *company, crowd\nSuing* the queen was all about;                               *following\nAnd, call'd by name each one and told,*                        *numbered\nWas none forgotten, young nor old.\nThere mighte men see joyes new,\nWhen the medicine, fine and true,\nThus restor'd had ev'ry wight,\nSo well the queen as the knight,\nUnto perfect joy and heal,\nThat *floating they were in such weal*                 *swimming in such\nAs folk that woulden in no wise                               happiness*\nDesire more perfect paradise.\n\nOn the morrow a general assembly was convoked, and it was\nresolved that the wedding feast should be celebrated within the\nisland. Messengers were sent to strange realms, to invite kings,\nqueens, duchesses, and princesses; and a special embassy was\ndespatched, in the magic barge, to seek the poet's mistress --\nwho was brought back after fourteen days, to the great joy of\nthe queen. Next day took place the wedding of the prince and\nall the knights to the queen and all the ladies; and a three\nmonths' feast followed, on a large plain \"under a wood, in a\nchampaign, betwixt a river and a well, where never had abbey\nnor cell been, nor church, house, nor village, in time of any\nmanne's age.\" On the day after the general wedding, all\nentreated the poet's lady to consent to crown his love with\nmarriage; she yielded; the bridal was splendidly celebrated; and\nto the sound of marvellous music the poet awoke, to find\nneither lady nor creature -- but only old portraitures on the\ntapestry, of horsemen, hawks, and hounds, and hurt deer full of\nwounds. Great was his grief that he had lost all the bliss of his\ndream; and he concludes by praying his lady so to accept his\nlove-service, that the dream may turn to reality.\n\nOr elles, without more I pray,\nThat this night, ere it be day,\nI may unto my dream return,\nAnd sleeping so forth ay sojourn\nAboute the Isle of Pleasance,\n*Under my lady's obeisance,*                        *subject to my lady*\nIn her service, and in such wise,\nAs it may please her to devise;\nAnd grace once to be accept',\nLike as I dreamed when I slept,\nAnd dure a thousand year and ten\nIn her good will: Amen, amen!\n\n\nNotes to Chaucer's Dream\n\n\n1.

Hext: highest; from \"high,\" as \"next\" from \"nigh.\" Compare\nthe sounds of the German, \"hoechst,\" highest, and \"naechst,\"\nnext.\n\n4. \"Your brother friend,\" is the common reading; but the phrase\nhas no apparent applicability; and perhaps the better reading is\n\"our bother friend\" -- that is, the lady who has proved herself a\nfriend both to me and to you. In the same way, Reason, in\nTroilus' soliloquy on the impending loss of his mistress, is made,\naddressing Troilus and Cressida, to speaks of \"your bother,\" or\n\"bothe,\" love.\n\n5.

Salad: a small helmet; french, \"salade.\"\n\n8.

Tyrwhitt seems perfectly\njustified in placing the composition of the poem\nimmediately before that of Chaucer's magnum\nopus, and after the marriage of Richard II to his\nfirst queen, Anne of Bohemia. That event took\nplace in 1382; and since it is to Anne that the poet\nrefers when he makes Alcestis bid him give his\npoem to the queen \"at Eltham or at Sheen,\" the\n\"Legend\" could not have been written earlier. The\nold editions tell us that \"several ladies in the Court\ntook offence at Chaucer's large speeches against\nthe untruth of women; therefore the queen enjoin'd\nhim to compile this book in the commendation of\nsundry maidens and wives, who show'd themselves\nfaithful to faithless men. This seems to have been\nwritten after The Flower and the Leaf.\" Evidently it\nwas, for distinct references to that poem are to be\nfound in the Prologue; but more interesting is the\nindication which it furnishes, that \"Troilus and\nCressida\" was the work, not of the poet's youth,\nbut of his maturer age. We could hardly expect the\nqueen -- whether of Love or of England -- to\ndemand seriously from Chaucer a retractation of\nsentiments which he had expressed a full\ngeneration before, and for which he had made\natonement by the splendid praises of true love sung\nin \"The Court of Love,\" \"The Cuckoo and the\nNightingale,\" and other poems of youth and middle\nlife. But \"Troilus and Cressida\" is coupled with\n\"The Romance of the Rose,\" as one of the poems\nwhich had given offence to the servants and the\nGod of Love; therefore we may suppose it to have\nmore prominently engaged courtly notice at a later\nperiod of the poet's life, than even its undoubted\npopularity could explain. At whatever date, or in\nwhatever circumstances, undertaken, \"The Legend\nof Good Women\" is a fragment. There are several\nsigns that it was designed to contain the stories of\ntwenty-five ladies, although the number of the\ngood women is in the poem itself set down at\nnineteen; but nine legends only were actually\ncomposed, or have come down to us. They are,\nthose of Cleopatra Queen of Egypt (126 lines),\nThisbe of Babylon (218), Dido Queen of Carthage\n(442), Hypsipyle and Medea (312), Lucrece of\nRome (206), Ariadne of Athens (340), Phiomela\n(167), Phyllis (168), and Hypermnestra (162).\nPrefixed to these stories, which are translated or\nimitated from Ovid, is a Prologue containing 579\nlines -- the only part of the \"Legend\" given in the\npresent edition. It is by far the most original, the\nstrongest, and most pleasing part of the poem; the\ndescription of spring, and of his enjoyment of that\nseason, are in Chaucer's best manner; and the\npolitical philosophy by which Alcestis mitigates the\nwrath of Cupid, adds another to the abounding\nproofs that, for his knowledge of the world,\nChaucer fairly merits the epithet of \"many-sided\"\nwhich Shakespeare has won by his knowledge of\nman.]\n\n\nA THOUSAND times I have hearde tell,\nThat there is joy in heav'n, and pain in hell;\nAnd I accord* it well that it is so;

meet,\nYielding honour, and humble obeisances,\nTo love, and did their other observances\nThat longen unto Love and to Nature;\nConstrue that as you list, I *do no cure.*                *care

Bernard, the Monke, saw not all, pardie!: a proverbial saying,\nsignifying that even the wisest, or those who claim to be the\nwisest, cannot know everything. Saint Bernard, who was the\nlast, or among the last, of the Fathers, lived in the first half of\nthe twelfth century.\n\n2. Compare Chaucer's account of his habits, in \"The House of\nFame.\"\n\n3. See introductory note to \"The Flower and the Leaf.\"\n\n4.                  \"ye have herebefore\nOf making ropen, and led away the corn\"\nThe meaning is, that the \"lovers\" have long ago said all that can\nbe said, by way of poetry, or \"making\" on the subject. See note\n89 to \"Troilus and Cressida\" for the etymology of \"making\"\nmeaning \"writing poetry.\"\n\n5. The poet glides here into an address to his lady.\n\n6. Europa was the daughter of Agenores, king of Phrygia. She\nwas carried away to Crete by Jupiter, disguised as a lovely and\ntame bull, on whose back Europa mounted as she was sporting\nwith her maidens by the sea-shore. The story is beautifully told\nin Horace, Odes, iii. 27.\n\n7. See \"The Assembly of Fowls,\" which was supposed to\nhappen on St. Valentine's day.\n\n8. The tidife:  The titmouse, or any other small bird, which\nsometimes brings up the cuckoo's young when its own have\nbeen destroyed. See note 44 to \"The Assembly of Fowls.\"\n\n9. Ethic: the \"Ethics\" of Aristotle.\n\n10. \"For as to me is lever none nor lother,\n    I n'am withholden yet with neither n'other.\"\ni.e For as neither is more liked or disliked by me, I am not\nbound by, holden to, either the one or the other.\n\n11. All of another tun i.e. wine of another tun -- a quite\ndifferent matter.\n\n12. Compare the description of the arbour in \"The Flower and\nthe Leaf.\"\n\n13. Flowrons: florets; little flowers on the disk of the main\nflower; French \"fleuron.\"\n\n14. Mr Bell thinks that Chaucer here praises the complaisance\nof Marcia, the wife of Cato, in complying with his will when he\nmade her over to his friend Hortensius. It would be in better\nkeeping with the spirit of the poet's praise, to believe that we\nshould read \"Porcia Catoun\" -- Porcia the daughter of Cato,\nwho was married to Brutus, and whose perfect wifehood has\nbeen celebrated in The Franklin's Tale. See note 25 to the\nFranklin's Tale.\n\n15. Isoude: See note 21 to \"The Assembly of Fowls\".\n\n16. Lavine: Lavinia, the heroine of the Aeneid, who became the\nwife of Aeneas.\n\n17. Polyxena, daughter of Priam, king of Troy, fell in\nlove with Achilles, and, when he was killed, she fled to the\nGreek camp, and slew herself on the tomb of her hero-lover.\n\n18. Mountance: extent, duration. See note 84 to \"The House of\nFame\".\n\n19. Relic: emblem; or cherished treasure; like the relics at\nthe shrines of saints.\n\n20. Losengeour: deceiver. See note 31 to the Nun's Priest's\nTale.\n\n21. \"Toteler\" is an old form of the word \"tatler,\" from the\nAnglo-Saxon, \"totaelan,\" to talk much, to tattle.\n\n22. Envy is lavender of the court alway: a \"lavender\"  is a\nwasherwoman or laundress; the word represents \"meretrice\"in\nDante's original -- meaning a courtezan; but we can well\nunderstand that Chaucer thought it prudent, and at the same\ntime more true to the moral state of the English Court, to\nchange the character assigned to Envy. He means that Envy is\nperpetually at Court, like some garrulous, bitter old woman\nemployed there in the most servile offices, who remains at her\npost through all the changes among the courtiers. The passage\ncited from Dante will be found in the \"Inferno,\" canto xiii. 64 --\n69.\n\n23. Chaucer says that the usurping lords who seized on the\ngovernment of the free Lombard cities, had no regard for any\nrule of government save sheer tyranny  -- but a natural lord, and\nno usurper, ought not to be a tyrant.\n\n24. Farmer: one who merely farms power or revenue for his\nown purposes and his own gain.\n\n25. This was the first version of the Knight's tale. See the\nintroductory note, above\n\n26. Boece: Boethius' \"De Consolatione Philosophiae;\" to which\nfrequent reference is made in The Canterbury Tales. See, for\ninstances, note 91 to the Knight's Tale; and note 34 to the\nSquire's Tale.\n\n27. A poem entitled \"The Lamentation of Mary Magdalene,\"\nsaid to have been \"taken out of St Origen,\" is included in the\neditions of Chaucer; but its authenticity, and consequently its\nidentity with the poem here mentioned, are doubted.\n\n28. For the story of Alcestis, see note 11 to \"The Court of\nLove.\"\n\n29. \"For he who gives a gift, or doth a grace,\n     Do it betimes, his thank is well the more\"\nA paraphrase of the well-known proverb, \"Bis dat qui cito dat.\"\n(\"He gives twice who gives promptly\")\n\n30. The same prohibition occurs in the Fifteenth Statute of \"The\nCourt of Love.\"\n\n31. Chaucer is always careful to allege his abstinence from the\npursuits of gallantry; he does so prominently in \"The Court of\nLove,\" \"The Assembly of Fowls,\" and \"The House of Fame.\"\n\n32. Pity runneth soon in gentle heart: the same is said of\nTheseus, in The Knight's Tale, and of Canace, by the falcon, in\nThe Squire's Tale.\n\n33. Stellify: assign to a place among the stars; as Jupiter did to\nAndromeda and Cassiopeia.\n\n34. Agathon: there was an Athenian dramatist of this name,\nwho might have made the virtues and fortunes of Alcestis his\ntheme; but the reference is too vague for the author to be\nidentified with any confidence.\n\n\n\n                       CHAUCER'S A.

B. C.\n\n1. Chaucer's A. B. C. -- a prayer to the Virgin, in twenty three\nverses, beginning with the letters of the alphabet in their\norder -- is said to have been written \"at the request of Blanche,\nDuchess of Lancaster, as a prayer for her private use, being a\nwoman in her religion very devout.\" It was first printed in\nSpeght's edition of 1597.\n\n2. La Priere De Nostre Dame: French, \"The Prayer of Our\nLady.\"\n\n3. Thieves seven: i.e. the seven deadly sins\n\n4. Mary's name recalls the waters of \"Marah\" or bitterness\n(Exod. xv. 23), or the prayer of Naomi in her grief that she\nmight be called not Naomi, but \"Mara\" (Ruth i. 20). Mary,\nhowever, is understood to mean \"exalted.\"\n\n5. A typical representation. See The Prioress's Tale, third\nstanza.\n\n6. The reference evidently is to Luke i. 38 -- \"Ecce ancilla\nDomini,\" (\"Behold the handmaid of the Lord\") the Virgin's\nhumble answer to Gabriel at the Annunciation.\n\n7. \"Xpe\" represents the Greek letters chi rho epsilon, and is a\ncontraction for \"Christe.\"\n\n8. According to tradition, the soldier who struck the Saviour to\nthe heart with his spear was named Longeus, and was blind;\nbut, touching his eyes by chance with the mingled blood and\nwater that flowed down the shaft upon his hands, he was\ninstantly restored to sight.\n\n9. \"In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of\nDavid and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for\nuncleanness\" (Zech. xiii. 1).\n\n\n\n                 A GOODLY BALLAD OF CHAUCER.<1>\n\n\nMOTHER of nurture, best belov'd of all,\nAnd freshe flow'r, to whom good thrift God send\nYour child, if it lust* you me so to call,                       *please\n*All be I*  unable myself so to pretend,                  *although I be\nTo your discretion I recommend\nMy heart and all, with ev'ry circumstance,\nAll wholly to be under your governance.\n\nMost desire I, and have and ever shall,\nThinge which might your hearte's ease amend\nHave me excus'd, my power is but small;\nNathless, of right, ye oughte to commend\nMy goode will, which fame would entend*                  *attend, strive\nTo do you service; for my suffisance*                       *contentment\nIs wholly to be under your governance.\n\nMieux un in heart which never shall apall, <2>\nAy fresh and new, and right glad to dispend\nMy time in your service, what so befall,\nBeseeching your excellence to defend\nMy simpleness, if ignorance offend\nIn any wise; since that mine affiance\nIs wholly to be under your governance.\n\nDaisy of light, very ground of comfort,\nThe sunne's daughter ye light, as I read;\nFor when he west'reth, farewell your disport!\nBy your nature alone, right for pure dread\nOf the rude night, that with his *boistous weed*          *rude garment*\nOf darkness shadoweth our hemisphere,\nThen close ye, my life's lady dear!\n\nDawneth the day unto his kind resort,\nAnd Phoebus your father, with his streames red,\nAdorns the morrow, consuming the sort*                            *crowd\nOf misty cloudes, that would overlade\nTrue humble heartes with their mistihead.*           *dimness, mistiness\nNew comfort adaws,* when your eyen clear                 *dawns, awakens\nDisclose and spread, my life's lady dear.\n\nJe voudrais* -- but the greate God disposeth,              *I would wish\nAnd maketh casual, by his Providence,\nSuch thing as manne's fraile wit purposeth,\nAll for the best, if that your conscience\nNot grudge it, but in humble patience\nIt receive; for God saith, withoute fable,\nA faithful heart ever is acceptable.\n\nCauteles* whoso useth gladly, gloseth;**              *cautious speeches\nTo eschew such it is right high prudence;                    **deceiveth\nWhat ye said ones mine heart opposeth,\nThat my writing japes* in your absence            *jests, coarse stories\nPleased you much better than my presence:\nYet can I more; ye be not excusable;\nA faithful heart is ever acceptable.\n\nQuaketh my pen; my spirit supposeth\nThat in my writing ye will find offence;\nMine hearte welketh* thus; anon it riseth;              *withers, faints\nNow hot, now cold, and after in fervence;\nThat is amiss, is caus'd of negligence,\nAnd not of malice; therefore be merciable;\nA faithful heart is ever acceptable.\n\n                            L'Envoy.\n\nForthe, complaint! forth, lacking eloquence;\nForth little letter, of enditing lame!\nI have besought my lady's sapience\nOn thy behalfe, to accept in game\nThine inability; do thou the same.\nAbide! have more yet! *Je serve Joyesse!*                  *I serve Joy*\nNow forth, I close thee in holy Venus' name!\nThee shall unclose my hearte's governess.\n\n\nNotes To a Goodly Ballad Of Chaucer\n\n\n1. This elegant little poem is believed to have been addressed to\nMargaret, Countess of Pembroke, in whose name Chaucer\nfound one of those opportunities of praising the daisy he never\nlost. (Transcriber's note: Modern scholars believe that Chaucer\nwas not the author of this poem)\n\n2.

Tyrwhitt, founding on the reference to the Wife of Bath,\nplaces this among Chaucer's latest compositions; and states that\none Peter de Bukton held the office of king's escheator for\nYorkshire in 1397. In some of the old editions, the verses were\nmade the Envoy to the Book of the Duchess Blanche -- in very\nbad taste, when we consider that the object of that poem was to\nconsole John of Gaunt under the loss of his wife.\n\n2. \"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to\nmarry than to burn.\"  1 Cor. vii. 9\n\n3.
